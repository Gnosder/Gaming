# Outlands

A west marches styled game for PF2e.

## Player Information

### What players know

Outlands is a player driven experience. It is up to the players to plan out their excursions into the Outlands and to guide their own exploration. I.E. this is a West marches styled game. 
The Outlands are the result of a localised cataclysm that resulted in a planar overlay.

### What characters know

2 years ago a massive storm began to rage around the Silver Sea. After months of work, a talisman was created that allowed scouts to peirce the storm when they returned they reported a massive landmass had appeared where the Silver Sea used to be. The Yanai alliance began preperations to land an expeditionary force on the northern point of this new land. Six months before the Yanai Alliance were set to launch their expedition an interprising group known only as the Consortium built a copy of the talisman and launched its own explorers.

### Characters

Characters begin play at level 1 and are constructed using the rules and options in the core book only.

### Magic Items

Magic items can be found around the Outlands, they can also be crafted by the smith Andre. Crafting items requires materials harvested from the world or its monsters. Some materials can also be imported for gold. See Appendix-M for list of sample items.

### Hope's Gambit

The town gains exp when gold is returned to it at a rate of 1 xp per 1 gp. As it gains levels it grants all explorers bonuses.

## GM Information

### Campaign Key

All enries should follow the same format:
[Hex number] -- [Hex Name]

#### 0401 -- Shrublands -- Hope's Gambit

The settlement of Hope's Gambit and it's surrounding areas. 

#### 0201 -- Badlands -- PoI Monster Nest

##### Scouting Report

Followed game trail until terminus, found carcasses of several large animals -- possibly boar, but larger than normal -- trail of blood led to cave entrance. Seems of unnatural construction, too round, too smooth. 3 creatures spotted outside cave. Creatures are bi-pedal, around 5'6", weight indeterminate, they have an insectoid appearance. Red-brown chitonous exterior, hands end in pinchers. Look like small versions of the Umber Hulk drawings in Volo's Guide to Monsters, though less hulking and more sleek. Area seems to be a nest or community. Diplomacy possible.

#### 0102 -- Heavy Badlands -- PoI Monster Spore

##### Scounting Report

Came upon what appeared to be a nest. Though far larger than any I've ever seen. The nest was easily 20 feet wide and roughly ovular. Skeletal remains in nest indicate the owner is carnivorous and lack of tracks around the nest point towards the owner being avian. However there were no feathers or other avian features present in the nest. I found a scale that I returned to camp that didn't seem to fit any of the remains. Perhaps a flying reptile? or Wyvern?

#### 0302 -- Badlands -- PoI Structure

#### Scouting Report

A single, large structure half buried in the cracked earth. Appears to be pyramidal, though I can see only the top most parts. No entrance is available, but the stones should be easy enough to break through to make one. The stone does not appear native to the area, though that is as far as my expertise takes me. Suggesting follow up assessment, potential risk is unknown. No monster spore present.

#### 0303 -- Badlands -- PoI Beast Tribe encounter

#### Scouting Report

I got surprised -- ambushed, if you will -- by small creatures that resemble Kobolds, but they have strange ruby like growths on their bodies, doesn't look comfortable. The creatures seemed curious, they spoke to each other in a chittering speech that I'm not familiar with, though I can say for sure that it's not any dialect of Goblin, or Beast Common. I suppose I made a sudden move, or at least one they did not like as the creatures fled to the south. I waited a few minutes and then followed their trail, gingerly so as to not spook any watchers they left behind. After a time I arrived at what I can only describe as a town. Though the buildings are small and crudely made of mud and stone their intent as long term housing seems clear. I was not able to stay long as I was spotted and decided to leave before provoking a martial response. Diplomacy possible, but tred with care, Kobolds are cunning and visious bastards.
