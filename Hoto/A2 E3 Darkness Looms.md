### **Taunting Lines** *(For Roleplay Flavor)*
- **“Pathetic... is this all the orchard’s heroes can muster?”**  
- **“You’re but insects skittering in the dark. My roots go far deeper than you know.”**  
- **“Foolish little seedlings… you think you can stop the harvest?”** *(Reference to the necromancer's greater plan.)*  
- *(If a character nearly dies or fails a key roll:)* **“Ah… I see the rot has already taken hold of you.”**  

---

### **Encounter Balance**
- **Low threat**, but **high narrative weight**—this should be a **creepy, frustrating, and ominous** encounter.  
- The **shadow won’t kill players**, but it **wants them to feel weak and helpless.**  
- The **Summoned Thralls** keep it from being too easy.
