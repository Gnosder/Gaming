This adventure will cover travel to the fort (via montage), into a mystery, into an undercoft dungeon crawl which will end with the breaking of a curse and defeat of a boss (an amalgum of souls created by the curse)

# Part 1 - Travel Montage

Travel from Mariboko to Fort Drovast.There wont actually be any time pressure, but they don't know that. They will be told they need to get there ASAP. The tasks, in order, Pulling together the resources (1 hour. ~DC 16; Pass grants +2 to all future rolls), Navigating a ruined trail (8 hours. ~DC 12; costs 1 hour per point under the DC; A storm swept through from the north that destroyed the trail), crossing a landslide that wiped out part of the trail (30 min each test. ~DC 14; Failure costs 1 hour and must retest; cliffs to either side of a 30ft gap, 40ft drop), Navigating a ruined trail (4 hours. ~DC 16; costs 1 hour per point under the DC; A storm swept through from the north that destroyed the trail)

Whole trip takes 12 hours on foot, plus any prep and rest.
Gain exhaustion to get +1.

Minimum time cost is 14 hours. This will impose 1 exhaustion per 4 full hours over 8. This means 16, 20, 24, etc. A long rest w/ food/drink removes 2 levels.

Exhaution levels

# Part 2 - The Empty Fort

Perfect — you already have the spine of a tense mystery crawl.
Here’s a ready-to-run **one-hour segment** broken into beats, clues, and DCs. It’s written to hit the mood you described: eerie empty prison, signs of the *Undying Sentence* curse, and a gradual funnel toward the hidden undercroft entrance.

---

## Structure (Approx. 1 Hour)

| Phase | Scene                            | Purpose                                         | Time   |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **1** | Arrival / Outside Check          | Set tone, introduce curse aura                  | 10 min |
| **2** | Initial Exploration              | Empty prison, scattered clues                   | 15 min |
| **3** | Clue Gathering                   | Players piece together what happened            | 15 min |
| **4** | Discovery of the Hidden Entrance | Puzzle/skill challenge to reveal the undercroft | 20 min |

---

### Phase 1: Arrival (10 min)

**Read-aloud / vibe:**
The prison fortress looms on the ridge, gates ajar, no guards on the walls. Faint black feathers drift on the wind. You hear no birds, no insects — only a low hum of unnatural silence.

**Checks / hooks:**

* *Detect Magic / Arcana (DC 15):* Sense necrotic threads binding the whole place — anyone who dies here rises elsewhere.
* *Religion (DC 12):* Recognize the mark of the god of judgment/undeath etched faintly above the gates.
* *Wisdom (Perception) (DC 13):* Notice tracks of many booted feet leading *out* of the fortress, but no return tracks.

Reward: give them a Hero Token or advantage on their first investigation inside.

---

### Phase 2: Initial Exploration (15 min)

**Main areas:**

* **Gatehouse:** Crossbows still cocked, no bodies, chairs toppled.
* **Cell Blocks:** Doors unlocked, cells empty. One has claw marks inside — like something was yanked through stone.
* **Mess Hall / Chapel:** Spilled meals turned to ash. Hymn books missing pages; one page shows a skeletal hand brandishing chains.
* **Warden’s Office:** Desk overturned, iron key ring left behind. Ledger of “recent transfers” lists all prisoners as “redeployed.”

**Effects of the Curse:**

* *Any healing magic feels cold.*
* *Random whispers at edge of hearing (“No escape…”)*
* *A PC who touches the bars feels a faint brand burn into their palm (cosmetic but hints at the mark).*

---

### Phase 3: Clue Gathering (15 min)

Seed **3–4 clues** that triangulate the hidden undercroft entrance:

| Clue                                                                            | Where Found                    | DC                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Map fragment**: sketch of basement with a “sealed stair” under the chapel.    | Warden’s ledger or desk drawer | Investigation DC 13 |
| **Ritual Graffiti**: black ash symbols pointing “below.”                        | Cell block walls               | Arcana DC 12        |
| **Hollow Sound**: The chapel dais rings hollow when stepped on.                 | Chapel dais                    | Perception DC 15    |
| **Missing Bones**: The prison graveyard has fresh‐dug holes with bones missing. | Outside yard                   | Survival DC 12      |

You don’t need all of them; scatter them so at least two will get found. Each clue they collect lowers the DC to find the entrance by 2.

---

### Phase 4: Discovery of the Hidden Entrance (20 min)

**The Puzzle / Skill Challenge:**
The chapel dais is a heavy stone slab sealed with necrotic runes. To open it safely they must disrupt the runes or replicate a “key phrase” from the hymnbook fragments.

Give them **two options**:

* **Arcane Disruption:**

  * Arcana or Religion (DC 15) check to break the seal.
  * Failure: 1d6 necrotic damage + gain 1 level of your custom exhaustion.
* **Proper Ritual:**

  * Assemble the missing hymnbook lines from scraps (found in Phase 2).
  * Performance or Religion (DC 13) to recite; opens harmlessly.

**Alternative brute force:** Strength (Athletics) DC 20 to heave slab aside, triggers a necrotic burst (2d6 necrotic to everyone nearby) but works.

When opened, a cold draft rises, carrying a faint rattle of bones. Steps spiral down into darkness — the undercroft.

---

### Optional Tension Beat

While they’re solving the puzzle, the skeletal construct below finishes absorbing a section of bones. The floor trembles and they hear it moving — a countdown to the boss fight. This creates urgency.

---

### Outcomes / Transitions

* **If they do well:** They open the stair quietly and can descend with advantage on first round vs. the construct.
* **If they fail repeatedly:** Necrotic backlash or a skeletal swarm erupts from cracks before the big fight (mini-encounter to burn resources).
* **Either way:** They now know what happened to the prisoners/guards, the “Undying Sentence” curse is clear, and they’re on a direct path to the heart of it.

---

### DC Cheat Sheet (level 3 PCs)

| Type                         | DC    |
| ---------------------------- | ----- |
| Easy (most clues)            | 12–13 |
| Medium (sensitive/important) | 15    |
| Hard (forcing entrance)      | 20    |

---

Would you like me to also sketch **the undercroft encounter itself** (construct stats + environment) so you can drop it in immediately after this segment?

Here’s a **ready-to-run 5-room undercroft dungeon** that picks up right after the hidden stair. It’s built for 5 PCs at level 3 (2 ranged casters, 3 melee). It should run \~60–90 minutes including the fight.

---

## Undercroft of the Undying Sentence

> *A spiraling stair of cracked black stone descends into stale, cold air. Dust hangs like ash. At the bottom: a forgotten cult’s ossuary, now awakened.*

---

### Room 1 – Contraband Cache (“The Smuggler’s Antechamber”)

**Description:**
A low vaulted chamber lined with crude shelves and crates. Lanterns, shackles, bottles of rotgut, a few rusty blades, and one still-glowing driftglobe hang here. Guards once dumped seized contraband here, never going deeper.

**Features / Loot:**

* *Driftglobe* (floating light source; the PCs can use it).
* 2d4 **healing potions** (or equivalent minor consumables) hidden behind crates (Investigation DC 12).
* Faint whispers from the next chamber echo through a cracked archway.

This is your **resource room** — gives them a little prep before going deeper.

---

### Room 2 – The Hall of Silent Petitioners

**Description:**
Rows of kneeling stone figures line the walls — supplicants with faces erased. Each holds a bowl full of long-cooled ash. Faint necrotic glyphs run between them like veins.

**Hazards / Clues:**

* Detect Magic or Arcana DC 12: realize the glyphs are *not active* but form a path leading further in.
* Stepping on the glyphs without care triggers a necrotic puff (1d4 necrotic, DC 12 Con save half). It’s more about mood than damage.

This room sets the **cult flavor** and shows undeath imagery without a fight.

---

### Room 3 – Ossuary of the Forgotten

**Description:**
A massive ossuary: wall niches crammed with bones, skulls stacked like bricks. In the center, a dry fountain shaped like a skeletal tree, roots running into the floor toward the next chamber. Bones near the fountain are *missing*.

**Interaction:**

* Perception DC 13: Notice a faint tremor from below, like something breathing.
* Religion DC 12: Recognize the skeletal tree as a focus for undeath rituals.
* If PCs disturb the niches recklessly, a **skeletal swarm** (counts as 2 swarms of undead rats but made of tiny bones) pours out — a warm-up fight.

This room foreshadows the construct and the curse’s feeding network.

---

### Room 4 – The Chained Behemoth (“The Ossified Titan”)

**Description:**
An enormous vaulted chamber with a pit at its center. In the pit, an immense skeletal construct, easily 20 feet tall, formed of dozens of human remains fused together. Heavy black-iron chains and glowing glyphs hold it in stasis. Greenish necrotic streams flow from the floor into its ribcage.

**Behavior:**

* It’s inert but clearly *growing*. A bone hand occasionally twitches.
* Breaking the curse in Room 5 will **free it**.

**Stat Block:**
Use **Flesh Golem** base stats but:

* Undead instead of Construct.
* Hit Points: 93.
* AC: 13 (huge, easy to hit but lots of HP).
* Multiattack: 2 slam attacks +5 to hit, 2d8+3 bludgeoning.
* Add a “Bone Volley” every other round (ranged): Dex save DC 13, 2d6 piercing in 15-ft cone.
* When reduced to 0 hp, it collapses in a **bone explosion**: Dex save DC 13, 3d6 piercing.

It’s chained until the curse ends, so the PCs can pass it safely (but they’ll feel its malice).

Any attempt to harm it now only heals it (necrotic regeneration).

---

### Room 5 – The Heart of the Curse (“Judicator’s Reliquary”)

**Description:**
A circular sanctum. In the center stands a black iron lectern atop a sunken sigil. Upon it: the **Chains of Sentence** — the relic feeding the curse. Necrotic energy pulses to Room 4.

**Breaking the Curse:**
Give them a **skill challenge / puzzle**:

* Three glyph-stones around the room each show a fragment of an invocation.
* Correctly aligning them and reciting (Religion/Arcana DC 13) severs the curse cleanly.
* Smashing the lectern (Athletics DC 18) also works but triggers backlash: each PC takes 2d6 necrotic and the construct starts with temporary HP.
* The more elegant they solve it, the less the boss is empowered.

Once the curse breaks:

* Chains in Room 4 shatter.
* Tremor shakes the undercroft.
* The **Ossified Titan** rises and charges in (or smashes through the wall into Room 5).

---

### The Boss Fight – Ossified Titan

**Setup:**
Battle in Room 5 with columns and broken glyphs for cover. The Titan bursts in dramatically.
Give them environmental edges:

* Columns can be knocked down (Athletics DC 14) to pin or slow it for 1 round.
* Glyphs still spark — Arcana DC 13 to siphon necrotic energy and heal or deal radiant damage.

**Goal:**
Big cinematic fight — 3 melee PCs can engage it, 2 casters can kite and use environment.
Titan HP 90–100, AC 13, slam 2d8+3, bone volley 2d6, bone explosion on death.

---

### Outcomes

* **If PCs win cleanly:** The curse ends permanently. The fort’s mark fades. They can rescue any remaining souls.
* **If they win messily:** They destroy the Titan but the curse’s remnants scatter (future hook).
* **If they lose / retreat:** Titan escapes into the world above — a roaming mega-skeleton for a later session.

---

### GM Tips for Pace

* Rooms 1–3: 5–10 min each. Keep description evocative but short.
* Room 4: Show, don’t fight yet. Big reveal, pass through.
* Room 5: Quick puzzle + then combat. This is your 30-40 min chunk.

---

Would you like me to make a **single-page “dungeon key”** (just bullet points for each room + DCs + monster stats) so you can print it out as a cheat sheet for tonight?


Great, let’s turn this into a ready-to-run prop hunt + ordering puzzle.
You’ll be able to hand them six cards with symbols on them, and read passages as they’re discovered.

---

## Overview

* **6 Sigils (cards):** Two hidden in the prison above, four hidden in the undercroft.
* **6 Passages:** Four true hints, one red herring, one “flavor” ominous line.
* **Correct Order:** Death → Chain → Soul → Bone → Blood → Judgement
* **Failure Penalty:** 2d6 necrotic damage to a random PC; sigils reset.

---

### The Six Sigils

| # | Sigil (Card Symbol)                      | Meaning   | Location                                      | How Found                                                                  |
| - | ---------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Skull** (♠ Ace or draw a skull)        | Death     | Prison Chapel dais                            | Perception DC 13 – carved under the lectern                                |
| 2 | **Broken Chain** (♣ Ace or draw a chain) | Binding   | Warden’s Office                               | Investigation DC 12 – in a hidden compartment of his desk                  |
| 3 | **Ghostly Mask** (♥ Ace or mask symbol)  | Soul      | Room 1 of the undercroft (contraband storage) | Inside a smuggled reliquary box – Thieves’ Tools DC 13 to open or smash it |
| 4 | **Bone Spiral** (♦ Ace or spiral)        | Bone      | Room 2 (ritual antechamber)                   | Religion DC 13 to notice it painted in glow-ink on the ceiling beams       |
| 5 | **Blood Droplet** (red dot)              | Blood     | Room 3 (collapsed shrine)                     | Perception DC 12 – mixed with old wax on altar; scraping reveals the sigil |
| 6 | **Scales of Judgement** (draw scales)    | Judgement | Room 4 (construct chamber)                    | Arcana DC 14 to see it etched faintly into the stasis chains of the Titan  |

(You can literally draw or print the symbol and title on an index card and hand it over.)

---

### The Passages

| # | Location                             | How Found             | Passage Text                                     | True?                      |
| - | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| A | Prison Chapel hymnbook scrap         | Simple pick-up        | “First comes Death, for all roads begin there.”  | ✅ True                     |
| B | Warden’s Journal                     | Investigation DC 12   | “Bind the fallen before their souls depart.”     | ✅ True (Chain before Soul) |
| C | Undercroft Room 2 (cult murals)      | Arcana/Religion DC 13 | “The bones remember before the soul forgets.”    | ✅ True (Bone before Blood) |
| D | Undercroft Room 3 (false mural)      | Perception DC 13      | “Blood washes the chain before Death can judge.” | ❌ Red herring              |
| E | Undercroft Room 4 (construct chains) | Obvious on approach   | “Judgement waits at the end of all things.”      | ✅ True (Judgement last)    |
| F | Prison Yard gravestone               | Simple                | “Six keys to unmake the sentence.”               | Flavor only                |

---

### Correct Order (with reasoning)

1. **Death** (“First comes Death…”)
2. **Chain** (“Bind the fallen before their souls depart.”)
3. **Soul** (implied by B)
4. **Bone** (“The bones remember before the soul forgets.”)
5. **Blood** (only left and red herring tries to mislead)
6. **Judgement** (“Judgement waits at the end of all things.”)

---

### Running the Puzzle at the Table

* Lay out all six sigil cards face up when they reach the final altar.
* They must physically arrange them in order.
* Allow 3 attempts before the Titan awakens early.
* **On each incorrect attempt:** 2d6 necrotic damage to a random PC (or all PCs in a 10-ft radius). Describe the altar’s backlash: black veins lashing outward.
* **On success:** The curse shatters, chains fall off the Titan, the fight begins.

**Scaling the Punishment:**

* If you want more tension: 3d6 necrotic per wrong attempt and give them only 2 tries before auto-awakening.
* If you want to soften: 1d6 and 4 tries.

---

### Quick Table Reference

| Step                                                           | At Table |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Hand out sigil cards as they’re found.                         |          |
| Read each passage as soon as it’s discovered.                  |          |
| At the altar, ask them to line up the six cards.               |          |
| Wrong order → roll 1d5 to choose random PC, deal 2d6 necrotic. |          |
| Success → curse breaks, Titan awakens, roll initiative.        |          |

---

Would you like me to give you a **one-sentence description for each of the 5 rooms** (with DCs baked in) so you can run the whole undercroft as a straight read-through? (I can put it in a quick printable page.)


Here’s a full **drop-in encounter** for the Titan in the undercroft’s fourth chamber, tuned for 5 level-3 characters and designed to feel “larger than life.” Everything is in one place so you can just read from it at the table.

---

## **The Battlefield: Chamber of Chains**

A vast, low-lit circular chamber (60-ft diameter).

* **Center:** A 15-ft-tall **Skeletal Titan** bound by four black-iron chains to giant stone pillars.
* **Floor:** Cracked flagstones with shallow runes glowing faintly; scattered bones swirl in eddies of necrotic energy.
* **Pillars:** Each pillar is 5-ft wide, 15-ft tall; provide half-cover.
* **Stasis Chains:** Four chains radiate from the Titan to the pillars; while intact the Titan is inert but lashes out with lair effects.
* **Exits:** One stair back up, one sealed door deeper (to the Curse Heart).

> **Tactical Notes:** Before the curse is broken the Titan cannot move but can make a few lair actions to harass the party. Once freed it becomes fully mobile and deadly.

---

## **Environmental Effects**

* **Lair Action (while chained):** On initiative count 20 (losing ties), choose one:

  * **Bone Shards:** Bones whip up in a 15-ft radius of a random PC, Dex save DC 13 or take 1d6 piercing.
  * **Necrotic Pulse:** Black energy ripples from the Titan. All within 20 ft make Con save DC 13 or gain 1 level of custom exhaustion.

* **Chains as Hazards:** A PC adjacent to a chain can spend an action to disrupt it (Strength check DC 15 or 10 damage to the chain AC 15 HP 20). Breaking a chain weakens the Titan (-5 HP threshold each).

* **Dim Light:** The whole room is dimly lit unless they bring bright light. Titan sees fine in darkness.

---

## **Skeletal Titan**

*Huge undead, neutral evil*

**Armor Class** 15 (bone plates)
**Hit Points** 110 (13d12+26)
**Speed** 30 ft (0 while chained)

| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| 20 (+5) | 12 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 6 (-2) | 12 (+1) | 8 (-1) |

**Saving Throws** Con +4, Wis +3
**Damage Resistances** bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from nonmagical attacks
**Damage Immunities** poison; Condition Immunities charmed, exhaustion, poisoned
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft, passive Perception 11
**Languages** understands Common but can’t speak
**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP)

---

### **Special Traits**

* **Bone Storm (Recharge 5–6).** The Titan slams the ground, sending whirling bones in a 20-ft radius. Each creature must make a Dex save DC 14, taking 3d6 piercing + 2d6 necrotic on a fail, half on success.
* **Soul Hunger.** Whenever the Titan drops a creature to 0 HP, it regains 10 HP.
* **Colossal Stride.** It can step over Medium creatures without penalty and can move through their space but can’t end its turn there.

---

### **Actions**

**Multiattack.** Two *Bone Fist* attacks.

**Bone Fist.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft, one target.
Hit: 13 (2d8+5) bludgeoning + 4 (1d8) necrotic.

**Grave Chain (Recharge 4–6).** The Titan lashes a spectral chain at a creature within 30 ft. *+6 to hit;* Hit: 2d10 necrotic and the target must succeed on a Str save DC 14 or be pulled 15 ft toward the Titan and knocked prone.

---

### **Tactics**

* While chained: uses lair actions and Grave Chain to harass.
* Once freed: opens with Bone Storm, then wades into melee, focusing on casters.
* Retreats or fights to destruction; it’s an automaton of the curse.

---

## **Loot (after the Titan’s destruction)**

The bones collapse into a mound; within are these rewards:

1. **Phantom Manacles** (utility).

   * *Wondrous item, uncommon.*
   * Can be thrown to create spectral restraints on a creature within 20 ft (Dex save DC 13 or restrained for 1 minute; one use per long rest).

2. **Charm of the Gravewarden** (utility).

   * *Charm, uncommon.*
   * While you wear it, you can cast *Detect Magic* at will, but only on undead or necrotic effects. Once per long rest you may gain resistance to necrotic damage for 1 minute.

3. **Rune of Necrotic Reversal** (weapon rune).

   * *Uncommon.*
   * Can be etched onto any weapon during a short rest. Once per turn when you hit an undead with this weapon, you deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage. If you crit, the undead must succeed on a Con save DC 13 or be stunned until the end of your next turn.

---

### **Scaling Notes**

* For a lighter fight: drop HP to 80 and reduce Bone Storm to 2d6/1d6.
* For a nastier fight: add one skeletal brute (MM Skeleton stat block but Large) emerging from bone piles at round 3.

---

Want me to also write a **one-paragraph read-aloud** for when the Titan awakens (chains breaking, room shaking)?
