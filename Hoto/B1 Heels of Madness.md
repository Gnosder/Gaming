# On the Heels of Maddness

After being revealed to be Shadow Breakers, the heroes are sent to the castle to stop whatever is going on there. Unbeknownst to them the way to the castle has been strewn with traps (the seer, who was taken, was forced to predict attempts to arrive at the castle, as an act of rebilion they undersold the threats).

Prompt I gave to gpt: I need a dnd adventure for 4 2nd level characters that will last about 3 hours. It should be built off of the previous adventure where they fought the necromancer's shadow. I want this adventure to cover the journey to the necromancer's castle (he moved into an abandoned castle some time ago). It should include mostly roleplay and puzzle encounters but should end with a boss battle outside the castle gates.  I'm thinking they arrive at a town beset by undead and help pick up the pieces after the latest attack. Let's lean into gothic horror.  Off the path to castle there should be an optional encounter with a hag, she lives in the forest alone and acts kindly to get people to come into her home so she can eat them (she prefers to eat children).

Act 1: Town of Black Hollow

Description

The party arrives at Black Hollow. The town is small, maybe 60 people, with a large church at its center and a dense pallisade ringing the buildings. The only way in is littered with broken carts and hastly constructed barricades. Dried blood and vicera are splashed liberally around the area, but there are no bodies. There is no one on guard. The town appears closed up with doors barred and windows shuttered. The smoldering remains of a bonfire can be seen off to one side of the church, littered with chared human remains. The door to the church is standing cracked open, and movement can be seen from within. 

Key NPCS:

Mayor Helena: A determined leader and ranger who pleads for help to restore order and protect the survivors.

Father Ambrose: Offers insight into strange omens, mentioning that the undead seem to be drawn toward an old castle.

Grieving Familiy: A distrought family whose child went missing during the undead assult. The child was taken to the witch.

The Dark Stranger: He passed through the town not long ago, several days latter the undead began attacking. No one remembers his name or face (mind fog curse) (Jordan Ambrose, Father Ambrose's Grandson who was supposidly killed a few years ago by Orcs)

Key PoIs:

Church of the Green Mother: the town's local church that has been converted into a shelter and field hospital.

Black Hollow Crypt: The town's ornate graveyard. Several graves have been defiled (as if the occupants tried to claw their way out) and is now warded by clerical magic. Has a puzzle, left by the Stranger.

Encounter 1: The church

Father Ambrose is treating wounded, he's out of spells and using bandages and polticies. With the assistence of another caster he can heal wounds as a ritual.

Mayor Helena is fixing weapons and readying a battle plan for the next attack.

The others are eating and resting, recovering from the previous night's battle. One mother is inconsolible.

Clues:

Can learn about the stranger and the crypt as well as rumors about the old castle in the forest. (it was built long before there was a forest there.)

Encounter 2: The Crypt

Description: 

The town's ornate graveyard has seen better days. Several graves have been defiled, as if dug up from the inside and the area is encircled by white paint forming protective runes. At the center is an ornate Columbarium (place for keeping ashes) that appears untouched.

The Columbarium is warded by the stranger against undead (to be protected and never touched) and has a riddle carved into some of the placards. The largest placard has a shrine set in it. On the shrine is a relief that depicts the phases of the moon (see handout).

Act 2: The Journey and the Enchanted Forest (≈1 hour 15 minutes)
Scene 2: The Road Through the Dark Forest

    Travel Description:
    The path to the castle leads through a dense, mist-shrouded forest. Describe twisted trees, eerie sounds, and faint, ghostly figures.
    Roleplaying Opportunities:
        Spectral Whispers: The party might hear disembodied voices offering cryptic advice or warnings.
        
        Wandering Ghost: A benig spirit that is briefly encountered who warns, “Stay on the path… and beware the sweet words of the forest’s lady.” It knows nothing of the goings on and will say nothing else.

Encounter 2 (Optional): The Hag’s Deceptive Home

    Setup:
    Off the beaten path, the party stumbles upon a charming, ivy-covered cottage. A sign reads “Tea & Kindness – All Welcome.”
    Granny Maribel -- The Hag (In Disguise):
    Appearing as an elderly, kindly woman, she invites the party (or perhaps a vulnerable child in the group) for refreshments and conversation.
    Roleplaying & Skill Checks:
        Insight/Perception Checks: Observant characters might notice something unsettling (e.g., a lingering rotten scent, an unnaturally bright gleam in her eyes, or odd, macabre details in the décor).
        Social Interaction: Encourage conversation where the hag might ask probing, unsettling questions about their journey and family.
    Possible Outcomes:
        If Suspicious:
        The party might politely decline her hospitality, avoiding the trap.
        If Fooled:
        She could try to lure one or more characters into a more secluded area. A combat encounter could ensue (using a hag stat block, with a predilection for targeting children or the most vulnerable party member).
        If Negotiated:
        She might offer misleading information about the castle’s defenses or even a cursed “blessing” that hinders the party later.

    The missing child is in the Hag's basement.

Encounter 3: The Enchanted Stone Well Puzzle

    Location:

    Along the forest path near the castle a stone well can be seen protruding from the underbrush. A warded path leads up to it (to protect from the dangers of the forest).

    Location:
    Along the forest path near the castle, the party encounters an ancient circle of moss-covered stones blocking the road.
    Puzzle Mechanics:
    Each stone is etched with runes or symbols representing different phases of the moon or aspects of the necromancer’s power.
        The Riddle: “I mark the passage from dark to light; align me true to walk the night.”
        Player Task:
        Arrange the stones in the order indicated by clues—perhaps using hints from the map or a note found in the town crypt.
    Outcome:
    Success clears the path and may trigger a brief, non-lethal magical effect (a spectral light that guides them) or even reveal an additional clue about the necromancer’s vulnerabilities.

Act 3: The Abandoned Castle and the Final Confrontation (≈1 hour)
Scene 3: Approaching the Castle

    Description:
    The castle looms atop a hill, its crumbling towers silhouetted against a brooding sky. The atmosphere is heavy with dread as skeletal sentinels are visible along the ramparts.
    Roleplaying Encounter:
    A ghostly apparition of a former castle guardian (a regretful soul trapped by the necromancer) briefly appears. He warns, “Beyond these gates, death wears a crown. Proceed with care, brave souls.”

Encounter 4: The Castle Gate Puzzle

    Setup:
    At the main gate, a heavy, iron-bound door stands locked. Gothic inscriptions and magical runes cover its surface.
    Puzzle Mechanics:
    The gate is locked with 3 arcane keys (1 in the crypt, 1 with granny, and 1 in the stone well)
        DC 20 str to break open -5 per key. Open free with all keys.
    Outcome:
    Success forces the gate open with a burst of energy, setting the stage for the boss battle outside.

Final Encounter: Boss Battle – The Undead Warden

    Location:
    Just outside the castle gates, where the land meets the crumbling stone, the final enemy awaits.
    The Undead Warden:
    A formidable skeletal knight or revenant (a magically animated guardian) created by the necromancer to protect his new abode.
        Abilities & Tactics:
            Uses a cursed weapon that deals necrotic damage.
            Can raise minor undead minions during the battle (1–2 skeletons or zombie tokens) to support him.
            Employs defensive tactics, using the terrain (crumbling walls, narrow passages) to his advantage.
        Gothic Horror Elements:
        Describe the clash as a desperate struggle against a remnant of dark magic—a battle underscored by echoes of lost souls and the oppressive chill of death.
    Victory Outcome:
    Defeating the Undead Warden secures the entrance to the castle and provides clues (perhaps a scrap of parchment on his person or a whispered dying confession) that hint at the necromancer’s plans and vulnerabilities. The townsfolk’s future, and the party’s next steps, now hang in the balance.
