### Title: *The Ruins of Frosthaven*

#### Hook:
The adventurers find themselves in the bustling town of Greenridge, where rumors spread of a cursed ruin deep in the Frosthaven Forest. A local merchant, Elara, pleads with them to recover a family heirloom—a jade amulet—from the ruins. She offers gold and local renown as payment.

---

#### Key Locations:
1. **Frosthaven Forest (30 minutes)**  
   - **Encounter**: Band of 4 goblins ambush the group on the forest trail. 
   - **Skill Check**: Players can avoid the ambush with a successful group Stealth (DC 13) or Perception (DC 14) check.
   - **Reward**: Small pouch of coins and a mysterious note in Goblin script hinting at danger within the ruins.

2. **Ruined Courtyard (45 minutes)**  
   - **Puzzle**: A magically sealed door requires solving a riddle or placing specific colored stones in the correct order.  
     Riddle: "I am always running but never move. What am I?" *(Answer: Time)*  
   - **Combat/Obstacle**: Skeleton guardians (2 skeletons per pair of adventurers).  
   - **Reward**: A healing potion hidden in an old chest.

3. **Chamber of the Frostheart (60 minutes)**  
   - **Boss Encounter**: Ice Wraith guarding the jade amulet. The Wraith summons icicles as lair actions and attacks with chilling touch.  
   - **Tactics**: Wraith retreats to the shadows if heavily damaged, creating a tense final stand.  
   - **Reward**: Jade amulet and a Frostheart Shard (provides temporary resistance to cold damage).  

---

#### Adjustments for New Players:
- Provide pre-made characters or simple character-building guidance.
- Use simplified monster stats for faster combat resolution.
- Focus on clear descriptions and generous hints for the puzzle and roleplay.
