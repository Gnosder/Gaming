# Act 3 -- Fort Drovast

Synopsis:

The Zuraroka Highlands is under assault by undead. Madamme Visha belives they are the Nokari clan raised from the dead and seeking revenge. HOTO travels from Varkusa Bay to Mariboko by boat. Once at Mariboko they begin to witness the effects of the invasion. The Dominion mayor refuses to accept that anything is happening, he dismisses 'proof' as either fabricated or outliers, he is waiting for his Scouts to return (They're dead and he is being indirectly manipulated from afar). Hoto must find the cultists who are controlling the mayor in order to protect the town and open the [easy] way to Fort Drovast. The road to the fort is dangerous and, towards the end, has been destroyed, it is guarded by a band of undead goblins that live in the nearby deep jungle. The fort itself has fallen. The prisoners are all undead serveters and are exhuming the bodies of the Nokari for reanimation. The fort is under the control of the fallen warden and HOTO learn that, while this was the site of the Nokari capital, the Nokari had several large settelments in the Deep Jungle. (Weijab, aka Fort Drovast, was a 'trade capital'. While most of the Nokari stayed in the jungle, it was the way they connected to the wider region. It was also a minor port town. The Nokari had promised tribute to an Ocean spirit in the distant past and the shrine turned into a town, to the delight of the spirit; it is currently assisting the Risen Nokari in getting revenge.)

## Part 1 - Mariboko

Synopsis:

The town's Dominion appointed mayor is under the control of Ash-masked cultists hiding within the town. He has locked down travel out of the town, particularly to the north, and begun to take measures against the rising 'hysteria' in the town and to keep it quite (so as to not look bad). Mariboko is a fishing town, but the port is under lockdown and it exports rubber to Varkusa Bay.

DT:

Mayor Silan Drevven -- A self styled "man of reason", he has suffered from night terrors and has been self medicating with addictive and illegal Lotus Powder. He is under the subtle control of the Ash-Masked.

Harlon Veek -- Self appointed 'Commerce Minister" who is runs a profitable smuggling operation out of the town and is now profiting heavily from the lock down.

Eko Tamaro -- Native storyteller, young but soul aged, fears the undead and thinks they are the restless Nokari, spirits of the clan destroyed by the Dominion years ago. The Ash-Masked are a sign the land is rejecting its defile

PoI:

Mariboko

  Port Authority -- Office of Harlon Veek and the first place HOTO goes.

  Mayoral Residence -- Office of Mayor Silan Drevven, a dominion styled building direcetly across from the cultural long house.

  Mariboko Long House -- The once heart of the town where natives would gather, now mostly a watering hole for natives. Eko Tamaro tells stories by a spirit shrine in the long house.

### The Port

After arriving at the town, the Port Authority is the first place to visit. There Harlon can answer simple questions and scout out whether the characters are marks, prospective associates, or just chaff. Dominion often go to the Siren while natives prefer the longhouse. Still sore that the smoke house he ran burned down recently.

### The Screaming Siren

A local dominion tavern. The bar keep, Aster, is curt.

### The Longhouse

Once the heart of the town, the longhouse is used as a bar for natives. Serving nectars and fruit wines. There are 3 shrines to local spirits [jungle spirit], [sea spirit], [animal spirit]. Eko Tamaro is telling stories infront of the sea shrine. He Appeals to Players by:

- Sharing chilling oral tales about the Nokari.

- Asks the players to “listen to the drums in the tide” — he believes the sea itself is warning them.

- Offers them a carved Makaki bone charm for protection.

- He pleads not just for help but for recognition—for the players to see the Dominion’s crimes and stop further desecration.
- Quote: “What was buried has roots. And now the roots are bleeding.”

Session 2: On waves of Ash

Knowing her plan was discovered and she was about to be defeated, the Ash ritualist signaled her followers to attack the town. The mayor is dead and the few survivors are holed up in east wing of the building. Ash Masked Cultists have set the village longhouse on fire and locked the doors. Further, Ash-masked are storming the docks in an attempt to burn the fishing fleet. Their goals are to sow chaos, cripple the town's economy, and prevent word from getting out. They were planning for a full take over when reinforcements from the fort arrive. However, things are moving too quickly, instead they are attempting to raze the town.

Crisis Points: Ash Masked are assaulting the:

Long House, Port, and town hall. All are being: attacked; Set Aflame; then burned. HOTO will likely only be able to protect 2. At the town hall, the cultists have been using the mayor to help them smuggle supplies to the fort and they are attempting to destroy the records of those shipments.

Eko sent a runner to get HOTO. The runner lays out the scope of what's happening and tells them of the three primary hot spots. Eko is trying to pull villagers together south of town.
