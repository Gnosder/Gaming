I like the core of the cypher system. I like the hope/despair of shadowheart. I like the simple flexibility of Cypher. I like the evocative cinema of Draw Steel! I want to run ciematic sessions, with tactical combat. I also really want to run a dungeon/hex crawl. Can it be done with Draw Steel? yeah, I think so. Mash the 3 games togther?

    Don't use attribute pools. Stick to Stamina (make wounds an optional mod). Use recoveries

I like the 0 to hero. The BECMI run.(Beginner, Expert, Champion, Master, Immortal). Using Basic, Advanced, Master classes like in SotDL.

Begginer -- Level 0 and Begginer classes (0-3)
Expert, Champion -- Expert Classes (4-10); Champion at 7
Master, Immortal -- Master Classes (11+); Immortal at 15

Die System: 2d12; Dawn and Dusk. Against TN set by task level. 6 over/under is a crit pass/fail.

Each class has a heroic resource
    Basic classes have 2 triggers - start with [victories], gain 2 each round in combat, 1 unique trigger
        Grit -- gain 1 the first time you take damage each round.
        Focus -- gain 1 the first time you expend a surge each round.
        Vis -- gain 1 the first time a target takes typed damage in a round.
        Piety -- Can pray to gain more
        Presence -- gain 1 when a mark you placed is activated
        Drama -- Gain extra encouter from dramatic events, each event triggers only once.
    Expert classes gain 1 trigger and maybe change the resource (i.e. Grit to Rage for a barbarian) -
    Master classes gain 1 trigger maybe change the resource (i.e. Grit to Rage for a barbarian) or combine 2 resources -

    Inciting event determines Sin

    Role grants stats and abilities
    Goal determines extra experience trigger. (Morality and Sin grant extra experience)

    Characters have passive abilities, utility abilities, signature abiliites (1 from class, 1 from role) and Heroic Abilities.

Currencies, Meta: 
    Players: Destiny, Surge, Heroic Resource, Recoveries, Stamina, Victories
    GM: Doom, Malice

    Destiny is player specific. Gain 2 surge, reroll test.
    Surge: Spend for extra damage/effect
    Doom: Is the primary GM meta currency. Gain 2 malice, introduce a complication
    Malice: To trigger NPC abilities and effects

Modules:

System: Dusk Bastards (Shadow Cypher)

2d12; Dawn and Dusk. Against TN set by task level. 6 over/under is a crit pass/fail.
    Module: Position and Effect
        Tasks are rated Easy, Medium, Hard and the results are fail with cost, fail, succeed with cost, succeed, succeed with reward.
        Most tasks are medium. and rating is based off of the actor's position. See BitD. Possible effect grants +-1 result tier.
Tactical Combat

For attributes. I dislike the DnD 6 (wtf is wisdom or charisma?). I dislike the 1-20 scale (break them down to just bonuses). 3-5 is the sweet spot. Might, Speed, Intellect. Might, Agility, Reason, Intuition, Presence. Physical, Mental, Special. Body, Agility, Reaction, Strength, Willpower, Logic, Intuition, Charisma, Edge, Essence, Initiative, Magic, Resonance. Accuracy, Communication, Composition, Dexterity, Fighting, Intellegence, Perception, Stregnth, Willpower. Intellegence, Wits, Resolve, Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Presence, Manipulation, Composure. Stregnth, Dexterity, Constitution, Intellegence, Wisdom, Charisma.

How about 2 phys, 2 mental, 1 special.

Might, Agility, Reason, Intuition, Presence with Stamina (as HP), Willpower (as XX), and Composure (as XX).

I like the idea of have perception up there as well (or alertness/Awareness)

Final List:

Might, Agility, Reason, Awareness, Presence

Sub-Attributes: 

Size, Speed, Stability, Composure
