# **Life Path**

At each step the player will:

1. Choose something about their character.
2. Contribute something to the world.
3. Share authority over that contribution with another player.

This ensures no one is the sole author of their story, and the world grows richer through shared creation.

## **What is your Character? (Ancestry and God)**

At this step, you determine your character’s Ancestry (sometimes called Race) and any sub-ancestries. By making this choice, you declare that your chosen Ancestry exists in the world.

1. Choose your character’s Ancestry. Determine any perks or flaws related to that choice.
2. Name a God who is a patron of that Ancestry.
3. The active player chooses 2 domains of the God. Another player chooses a third domain and explains why the God has it.

*Note: Your character does not have to follow this God.*

## **Where is your Character From? (Culture and Virtue)**

Here, you choose your character’s culture and their starting Virtue.

1. Choose your character’s Culture and starting Virtue. (Your Inciting Event may change it later.)
2. Name and describe the place where your character grew up (village, temple, city, etc.).
3. The active player chooses 1 thing their home is known for, and how widely it is known (renown 0–6). Another player adds a second thing it is known for (with one less renown).

---

## **What did your Character Do? (Career and Vice)**

As your character grew, they took up a profession — something that gave them meaning or put food on the table.

1. Choose your character’s Career and Vice. (Your Inciting Event may change this later.)
2. Name an NPC who was important to your character.
3. The active player decides either the NPC’s role (mentor, rival, companion, etc.) **or** whether the relationship was good or bad. Another player defines the other.

---

## **Why did your Character Leave? (Inciting Event)**

Your character’s Inciting Event is the choice or event that drove them to become a Dusk Bastard. This is a turning point that may alter their Morality.

1. Choose your character’s Inciting Event.
2. This event implies some kind of conflict, mystery, or threat.
3. Another player decides whether it was resolved or unresolved **and** whether it affected your character’s Virtue or Vice. The active player then describes how it was resolved (or why it was not) **and** how it reinforced or changed the chosen Virtue or Vice.

*Note: You may change your Virtue or Vice at this step, regardless of which was originally chosen.*

---

## **What did your Character Choose to Become? (Class)**

After your Inciting Event (immediately or after reflection), your character became a Dusk Bastard and took up one of the basic classes.

1. Choose a basic Class (Warrior, Explorer, Adept, Speaker).
2. Describe how your character represents that Class — their look, their bearing, their presence.
3. Your character carries a scar from those early days. The active player chooses either what the scar looks like **or** how they got it. Another player decides the other.

---

## **What is your Character’s Role in the Group? (Role)**

No Dusk Bastard survives the Seeping Gloom alone. What is your place in the fellowship?

1. Choose your character’s Role.
2. Your character has a Bond with another character in the group.
3. The active player chooses which PC the bond is with. That PC’s player explains how the bond was forged.

*Note: Try to form bonds with characters who do not yet have one.*

---

## **Who does your Character Want to Be? (Goal)**

Every Dusk Bastard carries a hope — something they strive for, a light they follow. This is what sustains them against the Gloom.

1. Choose your character’s Goal. (This affects how they gain experience.)
2. Each Goal adds something unique — see your Goal’s entry for details.
3. Another player names one challenge your character will face in pursuing this Goal.
