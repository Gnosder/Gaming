Update rolls: Rolls that fail (under the target number) still have some effect. Rolls that Crit (6 over the TN) have an increased effect.


# Chapter 2 How to Play Dusk Bastards

The rules of Dusk Bastards are straightforwad; all gameplay is based around a few core concepts. This chapter provides a breif explanation of how to play the game. Once you understand the basic rules you can reference [**Chapter Rules of the Game**] for more indepth information.

Dusk Bastards uses 2 twelve-sided dice each of a different color to determine the results of most actions. The first die is known as the **Dawn** die, it represents hope, fate, and strength against the darkness. The second die is known as the **Dusk** die and represents dispair, doom, and surrender to the inevitable. This duality sits at the core of Dusk Bastards and these rolls will be far and away the most common, in fact if no particular roll is called for its safe to assume you roll 2d12. Both dice are added together to determine the total result and which of the two rolled higher is important for **destined effects**, dicussed in below and in detail in **CHAPTER**.

> While its important that both dice are different colors, it doesn't matter which is which so long as you know.

> Sometimes a third die will be called for as well, as in the case of advantage or disadvantage. This third die should be a different color than the first 2 and, for advantage, the two highest rolling dice are chosen while for disadvantage the lowest two are chosen.

*E.G.*  -- Steph attempts to climb a knotted rope. She has advantage on the roll. She rolls 3d12. 1 Dawn die, 1 Dusk die, and 1 bonus die. She gets 3,6,7 respectivly. The total result is 13 Dusk.

The game master sets a **difficulty** for any given task or action. There are 12 degrees of difficulty. Thus the task can be rated on a scale of 1 to 12.

Each difficulty has a target number associated with it. The target number is always 3 times the task's difficulty, so a difficulty 1 task has a target number of 3, but a difficulty 5 tasks has a target number of 15. To succeed at the task, you must roll the target number or higher. See the **Task Difficulty Table** (page XX) for guidence how this works.

Character skills, favorable circumstances, or excellent equipment can decrease the difficulty of a task. For example, if a character is trained in tracking, they turn a difficulty 6 tracking task into a difficulty 5 task. This is refered to as **easing** the difficulty by one step (If the number of steps is not specified, assume it's just one). If they are specialied in a task they ease it by 2 steps, meaning a difficulty 6 tracking task becomes a difficulty 4 tracking task. This may also be refferd to as *easing a task*. Sometimes a task can increase in difficulty, or be **hindered**. If a task is hindered, it increases in difficulty by the listed number of steps (or default 1 if none is specified).

A skill is a category of knowledge, ability, or activy relating to a task. A character who has a skill is better at completing the related tasks than a character who lacks the skill. A character's level of skill can be trained (reasonably skilled) or specialized (very skilled).

If a character is **trained** in a skill relating to a task, the task is eased by one step. If they are **specialized**, the task is eased by two steps. A skill can never ease a task's difficulty by more than two steps. Sometimes a character has an **inability** in a skill which hinders that skill's tasks by one step.

Anything else that eases a tasks difficulty (help from an ally, a useful piece of equipment, or some other advantage) is reffered to as an **asset**. Assets can never ease a task's difficulty by more than two steps.

A task's difficulty can also be eased by applying **Effort** (Described more in **CHAPTER**).

In sum, three things can ease a task: Skills, assets, and Effort.

If a task's difficulty is ever reduced to 0, no roll is needed and the task is completed.

## When to Roll

Anytime a character attempts an action or task, the GM will assign a difficulty to that action or task, and the character's player rolls 2d12 against the asoociated target number. Sometimes the GM will tell the player what the difficulty is, but sometimes they will choose not to revel that information.

If a character attempts something that has a difficulty of 0, no roll is needed; they just succeed. Skills, assets, and Effort can ease the difficulty of a task to 0, negating the need for a roll. If there is no roll, there is no chance for failure. However, this is also no chance for additional effects.

## Combat

Making an attack in combat works the same way as any other roll: the GM assigns a difficulty and you roll against the associated target number.

The difficulty of that attack roll depends on how powerful your opponent is. Just as tasks are rated from 1 to 12, creatures have a level from 1 to 12. Most of the time, the difficulty of the attack roll is the same as the creature's level. For example, a level 3 bandit has a target number of 9 to hit.

> Players make all the die rolls in Dusk Bastards. If a character attacks a creature, the players makes an attack roll. If a creature attacks a character, the player makes a defense roll.

The damage dealt by an attack is not determined by a roll, instead it's a flat number based on the weapon or attack used. For example, a medium weapon like a spear always does 4 points of damage.

> Damage can be increased by abilities and the expendature of destiny points.

A character's **Armor** characteristic reduces the damage from most attacks directed against them. They get armor from wearing physical armor or from special abilities. Like weapon damage, armor is flat value and not a roll. If a character is attacked, they may subtract their armor value from the damage they take. If a character's armor reduces an attack to 0, they take no damage from the attack, but the attack is still considered to have hit for the purposes of abilities.

In general both armor and weapons come in 3 broad tiers: Light, Medium, and Heavy. 

Light weapons deal 2 damage but always attack with advantage and Light armor has a Armor value of 1.

Medium weapons deal 4 damage and medium armor has an Armor value of 2, but increases the cost of spending speed points by 1.

Heavy weapons deal 6 damage but must be used in two hands and heavy armor has an Armor value of 3 but increases the cost of spending speed points by 2.

Each round in combat is broken up into 2 phases:  movement and action. During the movement phase, characters may take one or more move actions this is done from slowest to fastest. During the action phase, characters, from fastest to slowest, may take an action -- which will often be effected by the move action they took before.

## Destined Effects

Each time a player rolls the dice, they will trigger one of 3 destined effects. While the total result is a sum of both dice, regardless of which rolls above or below the other, which die rolls higher does have a bearing on which destined effect triggers. If the Dawn die rolls higher than the Dusk die, that is called a *Dawn* effect. If the Dusk die is higher that is called a *Dusk* effect and if both roll the same number that is an *Eclipse* effect.

A *Dawn* effect is beneficial for the player who rolled it. Their chracter gains one **Destiny** point they can use immediatley or hold for later. A character can only ever have a number of destiny points equal to their level, any extras must be spent immediately or are lost.

> **Destiny Uses**
> A character may spend any number of destiny points whenever they attempt a task.  Each point spent grants one of the following effects:
> - The character may reroll the task.
> - The character may regain 1 point to a characteristic pool.
> - The character may activate any relevant actions or abilities.

A *Dusk* effect is harmful to the players and gives the GM two **Doom** points which can be used immediatley or held for later. The GM can have any number of doom points.

An *Eclipse* effect is the universe attempting to even the scales. Both the character that rolled the effect and the GM lose up to one Destiny or Doom point.

## Range and Speed

Distance is simplified into four categories: immediate, short, long, and extreme.

Immediate distance from a character is within reach or within a few steps. At most, immediate disance is 10ft.

Short distance is anything greater than immediate (10ft) but less than 50ft.

Long distance is anything greater than short (50ft) but less than 100ft.

Extreme is anything greater than Long (100ft) but less than 500ft. Anything beyond that and the distances are always specified.

This makes it unnesscary to measure precise distances around a character. Immediate is right there, next to a character. Short is nearby. Long is farther off and extreme is very far off.

All weapons and abiliteis will use these terms for ranges.

As a move action, characters can typically move an immediate distance without penalty. Characters can attempt to mobe farther, but suffer increasing penalties to their actions depending on how fast they attempt to move.

## Experience Points

**Experience points** (XP) are rewards given to players for engaging with the world. Typically this means completing quests or missions, but could also be a reward for exploration such as discovering a new location or finding a secret treasure. There is no set list of what actions reward XP, the GM typically decides what they will reward in their game, but a good rule is to give out XP equal to the amount of destiny gained in a session.

Experince points are used for character advancement (for details, see **CHAPTER**).

## Other Dice

Occationally the game will require other dice to be rolled. Most commonly this will be a six-sided die (d6) or a 100 sided-die (d100 or d%).

For a d100, roll 2d10 with the first showing the 10s place and the second showing the 1s.
