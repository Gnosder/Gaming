# Creating Your Character

This chapter explains how to create characters in Dusk Bastards and the following chapters discuss each piece of the process in greater detail. The process of making a character involves a series of decisions that will shape your character, so the more you understand what kind of character you want to play the easier character creation will be. The process involves understanding the values of the game statistics and choosing the aspects that determine your character's capabilities.

## Character Stats

Every player character has three defining characteristics, which are typically called "statistics" or "stats". These stats are Might, Speed, and Intellect. They are broad categories that cover many different but related aspects of a character.

## Might

Might defines how strong and durable your character is. The concepts of strength, endurance, constituion, hardiness, and physical prowess are all folded into this one stat. Might governs actions from forcing doors open to walking for days without food to resisting disease. Physical characters, tough characters, and characters interested in fighting up close should focus on Might.

## Speed

Speed describes how fast and physically coordinated your character is. The stat embodies quikness, movement, dexterity, and reflexes. Speed governs such divergent actions as dodging attacks, sneaking around quietly, and throwing a ball accurately. It helps determine whether you can move farther on your turn. Nimble, fast, or sneaky characters will wand good Speed stats, as well as those interested in ranged combat.

## Intellect

This stat determines how smart, knowledgeable, and likable your character is. It includes intelligence, wisdom, charisma, education, reasoning, wit, willpower, and charm. Intellect governs solving puzzles, remembering facts, telling convincing lies, and using mental powers. Characters interested in communication effectively, being learned scholars, or wielding supernatural powers should stress their Intellect stat.

## Pool, Edge, and Effort

Each of the three stats has two components: Pool and Edge. Your Pool represents your raw, innate ability, and your Edge reprents knowing how to use what you have. A thrid element ties into this concept: Effort. When your character really needs to accomplish a task, you apply effort.

## Pool

Your Pool is the most basic measurement of a stat. Comparing the Pools of two creatuers will give you a general sense of which creature is superior in that stat. For example, a character who has a Might Pool of 16 is stronger (in a basic sense) than a character whos Might Pool is only 12. Most characters start with a Pool of 9 to 12 in most stats -- that's the average range.

You can spend points fromt one of your stat Pools to decrease a task's difficulty (see Effort, below) or to trigger your abilities. Some attacks may cause you to lose points from a pool, though this is not common. You can rest to recover lost points from a stat Pool, and some items or abilities may allow you to recover lost points more quickly.

## Edge

Although your Pool is the basic measurement of a stat, your Edge is also important. When something requires you to spend poitns from a stat Pool, your Edge for that stat reduces the cost. It also reduces the cost of applying Effort to a roll. Edge can reduce the cost of applying effort and using abilities to 0.

## Effort

When your character really need to accomplish a task, you can apply Effort. For a beginning character, applying Effort requries spending 3 points from the stat Pool appropriate to the action. Thus, if a character tries to dodge an attack (a Speed roll) and wants to increase the chance for success, you can apply Effort by spending 3 points from your Speed Pool. Effort eases the task by one step. This is refered to as applying one level of Effort.

You do not have to apply Effort if you don't want to, but if you do, you must apply it before you attempt the roll.

Applying more Effort can lower a task's difficulty further: each additional level of Effort eases the task by another step. Applying one level of Effort eases the task by one step, applying two levels eases the task by two steps, and so on. However, each level of Effort after the first costs only 2 points from the stat Pool instead of 3. So applying two levels of Effort costs 5 points and applying three levels costs 7 points, and so on.

Every character has an Effort score, which indicates the maximum levels of Effort that can be applied to a roll. A beginning (first level) character has an Effort of 1, meaning you can apply only one level of Effort to a roll. A more experience character has a higher Effort score and can apply more levels of Effort to a roll.

When you apply Effort, subtract your relevant Edge from the total cost of applying Effort. 

Skills and other advantages also ease a task, and you can use them in conjunction with Effort. In addition, your character might have special abiliteis or equipment that allow them to apply Effort to accomplish a special effect, such as knocking down a foe with an attack or affecting multiple targets with a power that normally affects only one.

## Effort and Damage

Instead of applying Effort to ease your attack, you can apply Effort to increase the amount of damage you inflict with an attack. For each level of Effort you apply in this way, you inflict 3 additional points of damage. This applies to any kind of attack that inflicts damage.

When using Effort to increase the damage of an area attack (one that hits multiple targets), you inflict 2 additional points of damage (instead of 3). However this damage is dealt to each target and even if a target resists the attack, they still take 1 point of damage.

## Multiple Uses of Effort and Edge

While you can apply as many levels of Effort as your Effort score, Edge only applies once per action.

## Character Levels

Every character starts in the game at the first level. Level is a measurement of power, toughness, and ability. Character can advance up to the sixth level. As your character advances to higher levels, you gain more abilities, increase your Effort, and can improve a stat's Edge ore increase a stat. Generally speaking, even first level characters are already quite capable. It's safe to assume that they've already got some experience under their belt. This is not a "zero to hero" progression, but rather an instance of competent people refining and honeing their capabilities and knowledge. Advancing to higher levels is not realy the goal of Dusk Bastard characters, but rather a representation of how characters progress in a story. To progress to the next tier, characters earn experience points (XP) by pursuing character arcs, going on adventures, and discovering new things. Experience can be spent a few ways, and one of them is to purchase character benefits. Each benefit costs 4 XP, and they can be purchased in any order but only one of each until you level up. Your character's level increases after buying all four benefits listed below:

- Increasing Capabilities: You gain 4 points to add to your stat pools. You can allocate the points among the Pools however you wish.
- Moving Toward Perfection: You add 1 to your Might Edge, SPeed Edge, or Intellect Edge (your choice).
- Extra Effort: Your Effort score increases by 1.
- Skilled: You become trained in one skill of your choice (Other than attacks or defense). You may also choose to become skilled in one of your character's abilities. IF you choose a skill that you are already trained in, you become specialized in that skill.

Other Options: Instead of gaining a skill a character can select one of the below other options:
- Reduce the cost for wearing armor by 1.
- Add 2 to your recovery rolls.
- Select a new class ability for your level or a lower level.

When a character levels up, they may gain new abilities from their class and roll, up to the maximum allowed. Further a character can trade out any number of abilites for new abilities.

## Character Descriptor, Class, and Role

To create your character, you build a simple statement that describes them. The statement takes this form: "I am a [fill in an adjective here] [fill in a noun here] who [fill in a verb here]."

Thus: "I am an *adjective* *noun* who *verbs*." For example, you might say, "I am a Rugged Warrior who Defends" or "I am a Charming Explorer who Strikes."

In this sentence, the adjective is called your **descriptor**.

The noun is your character's **class**.

The verb is your character's **role**.

Even though character class is in the middle of the sentence, that's were we'll start. (Just as in this sentence, the noun provides the foundation.)

Your character class is the core of your character. Your class helps determine your character's place in the world and relationship with other people in the setting. It's the noun of the sentence "I am an *adjective* *noun* who *verbs*."

A starting character may choose from the base classes in Chapter X: **Warriors**, **Adepts**, **Explorers**, and **Speakers**.

Your descriptor defines your character -- it colors everything you do. It is the adjective in the sentence "I am an *adjective* *noun* who *verbs*."

Unless your GM says otherwise you can choose from any of the character descriptors in Chapter X.

Finally, Role defines your character's place in the party. It helps you relate with other player characters in your group. It's the verb of the sentence "I am an *adjective* *noun* who *verbs*."

There are 4 main Roles to choose from Defender, Striker, Leader, Controller. Chapter X goes deeper in depth on each of them.

## Special Abilities

Character class and role grant PCs special abilites at each new level. Using the abilities usually costs points from your stat Pools; the cost is listed in parentheses after the ability name. Your Edge in the appropriate stat can reduce the cost of the ability, but remember that you can apply Edge only once per action.

Sometimes the point cost for an ability has a + sign after the number. That means you can spend more points or levels of Effort to improve the ability further, as explained in the ability description.

Many abilites grant a character the option to perfomr an action that they couldn't normally do, such as projecting rays of cold or attacking multiple foes at once. Using one of the abilities is an action unto itself, and the end of the ability's description says "Action" to remind you. It also might provide more information about when or how you perfomr the action.

Some special abilities allow you to perform a familiar action -- one you can already do -- in a differnt way. These abilites care called enablers. Using one of the abilities is not considered an action. Enablers either function constantly or happen as part of another action. If a specail ability is an enabler, the end of the ability's desctipion says "Enabler" to remind you.

You abilities specify a duration, but you can always end one of your own abilites anytime you wish.
