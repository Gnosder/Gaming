# Chapter 1 Into the Gloom

No one is sure when the universe came into being. Not even the Gods themselves know, though they can point to the exact moment it bagan to die. Eons of peace and joy were shattered when the Seeping Gloom appeared. Some say it slipped in through the cracks at the edge of reality. Others think it had always been there, waiting. Regardless, it made its presence felt, a gnawing unease in the gut, a flicker of fear in the gaze of a stranger, an inexplicable anxiety that crashes over even the most couragous. It was clear to all that the Seeping Gloom, dark entropy made manefest, wanted nothing less than the total destruction of our reality. The Gods held no more power to stop it than a man to halt the tide. Inevitability had been given form.

As time passed, despair began to brew in the hearts of the Gods. They saw their own deaths and had no way to avert it. One by one they surrendered to inevitability. Their immortality a curse and their despair unending.

But not all fell to the darkness. Some chose to rage against the dying of the light. Each had their own reason for doing so -- optimisim, spite, fierce defiance. Champions, all, they rose against the Seeping Gloom determined to drive it from existence. Their battle was fierce, their resolve unbreakable, but in the end... they lost.

Now the Gloom is part of life. Gods and Mortals alike try to find what joys they can as the darkness rises around them. But all is not lost. As reality sits on the edge of its ending, as the living stare into the uncompromising maw of death, as a deep malaise grips the hearts of the Gods, a rare few mortals spark their defiant light as the dark decends. These lights refuse to surrender to the Seeping Gloom. They refuse to let the fire of reality extinguish.

They are called, Dusk Bastards.

## Worlds of Dusk

The reality of Dusk Bastards is massive beyond imagining, this book will cover only a few of the worlds that can be found within it. All are different. Different cultures, different technologies, different dreams and desires; but all suffer under the Seeping Gloom. It is the one true constant in reality, though it effects each world differently.

In this reality magic takes many forms and comes from many places.
