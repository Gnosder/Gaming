# Chapter X Rules of the Game

Dusk Bastard games are played in the joint imagination of all the players, including the GM. The GM sets the scene, the players state what their characters attempt to do, and the GM determines what happens next. The rules and dice help make the game run smoothly, but it's the people, not the rules or dice, that direct the action and determine the story -- and the fun. If a rule gets in the way or detracts from the game, the players and GM should work together to change it.

**This is how you play Dusk Bastards:**

1. The player tells the GM what they want to do. This is a character action.
2. The GM determines if that action is routine (I.e. does not need a roll) or if there is a chance of failure.
3. If there is a chance of failure, the GM determines which stat the task uses (Migher, Speed, or Intellect) and the task's difficulty -- how hard it wil be on a scale from 1 (really easy) to 12 (basically impossible).
4. The player and the GM determine if anything about the character -- such as training, equipment, special abilities, or various actions -- can modify the difficulty up or down by one or more steps. If these meoifications reduce the difficulty to less than 1, the action is routine (and no roll is needed).
5. If the action still isn't routine, the GM uses its difficulty to determine its target number -- how high the player must roll to succeed at the action. The GM doesn't have to tell the player what the target number is, but they can give the player a hing, especially if the character would reasonably know if the action was easy, average, difficult, or impossible.
6. The player rolls 2d12 and notes the total and which of the 2 dice rolled highest. If the character or GM gains a Destiny or Doom point they may spend it now to change the target number. If the total is equal to or higher than the target number, the character succeeds.

That's it. That's how to do anything, whether it is identifying an unknown device, calming a raging drunk, or battling a demigot. Even if you ignored all the other rulse, you could still play Dusk Bastards with just this information. The key features here are: character actions, determining task difficulty, and determining modifications.

## Taking Action

As play progresses characters can take actions. In general each character can only take one **turn**, a chance to act, until all the other characters have taken an action, this is called a **round**. While there are different types of rounds (downtime, exploration/inquisition, combat) the process of taking actions is the same for each. In general each character can do one thing -- an action -- during each of their turns (though there are other types of actions listed below). All actions fall into one fo three categoreis, Might, Speed, or Intellect. Many actions require die rolls -- rolling 2d12.

Every action performs a task, and every task has a difficulty that determines what number a character must reach or surpass with a die roll to succeed.

Most tasks have a difficulty of 0, which means the character succeeds automatically. Actions that are susually difficult or that become difficult due to the situation have a higher difficulty. These actions usually require a roll.

Some action require a minimum expenditure of Might, Speed, or Intellect points. If a character cannot spend the minimum number of points needed to complete the action, they automatically fail at the task.

## Determining Task Stat

Every task relates to one of a character's threees stats: Might, Speed, Intellect. Physical activities that require strength, power, or endurance relate to Might. Physical activities that require agility, flexibility, or fast reflexes relate to Speed. Mental activities that require force of will, memory, or mental power relate to Intellect. This means you can generalize tasks into three categories: Might tasks, Speed tasks, and Intellect tasks. you can also generalize rolls into three categoreis: Might rolls, Speed rolls, and Intellect rolls.

The Category of the task or roll determines what kind of Effort you can apply to the roll and may determine how a character's other abilities affect the roll.

## Determining Task Difficulty

The most frequient thing a GM does during the game -- and probably the most important thing -- is set a task's difficulty. To make the job easier, use the Task Difficulty table, which associates a difficulty rating with a descriptive name, a target number, the percent chance of success and general guidence about the difficulty.

Every difficulty from 1 to 12 has a target number associated with it. The target number is easy to remember: it is always three times the difficulty. The target number is the minimum number a player needs to roll on 2d12 to succeed that the task. Moving up or down on the table is called easing or hindering, which is measured in steps.

A character's level does not determine a task's level. Things don't get more difficult just becasuse a character's level increases, though they do often find themselves in more difficult situations. Therefore, when setting the difficulty of a task, the GM should rate the task on its own merits, not on the power of the characters.

## Modifying the Difficulty

After the GM sets the difficulty for a task, the player can try to modify it for their character. Any such modification applies only to this particular attempt at the task.

By using skills and assets, working together, and applying Effort, a character can ease a task by multiple steps to make it easier. Rather than adding bonuses to the player's roll, reducing the difficulty lowers the target number. If they can reduce the difficulty of a task to 0, no roll is needed and success is automatic.

There are three basic ways in which a character can ease a task: skills, assets, and Effort. Each mehtod eases the task by at least one step.

### Skills

Characters may be skilled at performing a specific task. The first level of being skilled is called being *trained*, and it eases that task by one step. More rarely, a character can be incredibly skilled at performing a task. This is called being specialized, and it eases the task by two steps instead of one. Skills can never decrease a task by more than two steps.

### Assets

An asset is anything that helps a character with a task, such as having a really good crowbar when trying to force open a door or being in a rainstorm when trying to put out a fire. Appropriate assets vary from task to task. The perfect awl might help when woodworking, but it won't make a dance performance any better. An asset usually eases a task by one step. Assets can never ease a task by more than two steps -- any more than two steps from assets don't count.

### Effort

A character can apply Effort to ease a task. To do this, the player spends popints from the stat Pool that's most appropriate to the task. For every level of Effort spent on a task, the task is eased by one step. It costs 3 points form a stat Pool to apply one level of effort, and it costs 2 additional points for every level thereafter. A character must spend points from the same stat Pool as the type of task or roll.

Every character has a maximum level of Effort they can apply to a single task. Effort can never ease a task by more than six steps.

**Free Level of Effort:** A few abilities give you a free level of Effort. In effect, you're getting one more level of Effort than what you paid for. This free level of Effort can exceed the Effort limit for you character, but not the six-step limit for easing a task.

## Rolling the Die

To determine success or failure, a player rolls 2d12. If they roll the target number or higher, they succeed. Further each roll will also trigger a destined effect depending on which of the 2 d12s rolled higher.

## The Player Always Rolls

In Dusk Bastards, players always drive the action. That means they make all the die rolls. If a PC leaps out of a moviong vehicle, the player rolls to see if they succeed. If a PC searches for a hidden panel, the player rolls to determine whether they find it. If a rockslide falls on a PC, the palyer rolls to try to get out of the way. If a foe attacks a PC, the player rolls to see if they dodge the blow.

As shown by the last two example, the PC rolls whether they are attacking or defending. Thus, something that improves defense might ease or hinder their rolls. For example, if a PC uses a low wall to gain cover from attacks, the wall eases the player's defense rolls. If a foe uses the wall to gain cover from the PC's attacks, it hinders the player's attack rolls.

## Destined Effect

When a player rolls the dice they will add them together to determine the total result, but that is not all they must do. Of the two dice -- the Dawn die and the Dusk Die -- the one that rolls higher will determine which of the three destined effects trigger for that roll.

If the Dawn die rolls higher than the Dusk die, that is called a *Dawn* effect. If the Dusk die is higher that is called a *Dusk* effect and if both roll the same number that is an *Eclipse* effect.

A *Dawn* effect is beneficial for the player who rolled it. Their chracter gains one **Destiny** point they can use immediatley or hold for later. A character can only ever have a number of destiny points equal to their level, any extras must be spent immediately or are lost.

> **Destiny Uses**
> A character may spend any number of destiny points whenever they attempt a task.  Each point spent grants one of the following effects:
> - The character may reroll the task.
> - The character may regain 1 point to a characteristic pool.
> - The character may activate any relevant actions or abilities.

A *Dusk* effect is harmful to the players and gives the GM two **Doom** points which can be used immediatley or held for later. The GM can have any number of doom points.

An *Eclipse* effect is the universe attempting to even the scales. Both the character that rolled the effect and the GM lose up to one Destiny or Doom point. Further half the stat points the character spent on that action are refunded (round up).

## Retrying a Task After Failure

If a character fails a task they can attempt it again, but they must apply at least one level of Effort. A retry is a new action, not part of the same action that failed, and it takes the same amount of time as the first attempt did.

Sometimes the GM might rule that retries are impossible.

## Taking 20

Sometimes a character will have all the time they need to complete a task. In that case they can spend 20 times as long as the task usually takes before making the roll. If the character did, the lowest total result they can roll is 20 (they can roll higher, but not lower). Destined effects trigger as normal. Taking 20 does not lower the difficulty or target number of a task and so cannot negate the need for a roll.

## Initial Cost

The GM can assign a point cost to a task just for trying it. Called an initual cost, it's simply an indication that the task is particularly taxing. For example, let's say a character wants to try a Might action to open a heavy cellar door that is rusted shut. The GM says forcing the door open is a difficulty 5 task, and there's an initial cost of 3 Might points simply to try. This initial cost is in addition to any points the character chooses to spend on the roll and it does not affect the difficulty of the task. 

The GM may rule the additional cost applies to some characters and not otheres. For example, the GM might decide that a Wizard who tries to batter down a door must spend 3 Might to do so, but a fighter who tries the same thing does not.

## Range and Speed

Distance is simplified into four categories: immediate, short, long, and extreme.

**Immediate** distance from a character is within reach or within a few steps. At most, immediate disance is 10ft.

**Short** distance is anything greater than immediate (10ft) but less than 50ft.

**Long** distance is anything greater than short (50ft) but less than 100ft.

**Extreme** is anything greater than Long (100ft) but less than 500ft. 

Anything beyond that and the distances are always specified.

This makes it unnesscary to measure precise distances around a character. Immediate is right there, next to a character. Short is nearby. Long is farther off and extreme is very far off.

All weapons and abiliteis will use these terms for ranges.

As a move action, characters can typically move an immediate distance without penalty. Characters can attempt to mobe farther, but suffer increasing penalties to their actions depending on how fast they attempt to move.

GMs and players don't need to determine exact distances. For example, if the PCs are fighting a group of trooper, any character can likely attack any foe in the general melee -- they are all within immediate range. However, if one falls back to shoot the characters a character might have to use their entire action to move the short distance required to attack that foe. It doesn't matter if the trooper is 20 feet or 40 feet away -- it's simply considered short distance.

## Timekeeping

Generally, keep time the same way that you normally would, using minutes, hours, days, and weeks. Thus, if characters walk overland for 15 miles, about eight hours pass, even though the journy can be descrived in only a few moments at the gaming table. Precision timekeeping is rarely important. Most of the times, saying things like "that takes about an hour" works fine.

This is true even when a spefcial ability has a specific duration. In an encounter, a duration of "one minute" is mostly the same as saying "the rest of the encounter." You don't have to track each round that ticks by if you don't want to. Likewise an ability that lasts for ten minutes can safely be considered the legnth of an in-depth conversation, the it takes to quickyl explore a small area, or the time it taksee to rest after a strenuous activity.

That said, there are a few *time scales* that are worth keeping in mind that can make things easier. These are: downtime, exploration, and combat. Each of the time scales has rounds and in each round each chracter gets a turn. The main difference is how long each round lasts. In general a combat round lasts for around 6 seconds while an exploration round lasts about 10 minutes. Finally a downtime round usually lasts a day, but can be longer depending on context.

## Encounters, Rounds, and Initiative

Sometimes in the course of the game, the GM or players will refer to an "encounter." Encounters are not so much measuremts of time as they are events of instances in which something happens, like a scene in a movie or a chapter in a book. An encounter might be a fight with a foe, a dramatic corssing of a raging river, or a stressful negotiation with an important official. It is useful to use the word when reffering to a specific scene, as in "My Might Pool is low after that encounter with the soul sorcerer yesterday."

Encounters are usually played out in a series of rounds. As stated above, the length of a round is determined by which time scale you are using -- though the most common, and the one that will be discussed here, is combat. A combat round usually lasts around 6 seconds (meaning 1 minute is 10 rounds). During a round each character gets to take one turn. 

To determine who goes first, second, and so on in a rouind, each player makes a Speed(Initiative) roll. NPCs often have a set initiative equal to their target number. Characters are placed in order from highest to lowest on a list.

Combat is broken up into 2 phases: Movement and Action. During the movement phase, starting from the lowest initiative and going to the highest, each character gets to take a move action. At any time a character that has not yet taken their movement may interrupt the movement of another character and takes their movement first. This allows faster characters to react to and, possibly, interrupt slower characters. Once each character has taken their movement action or passed the movement phase ends and the action phase beings. During the action phase, starting from the highest initiative and going to the lowest, each character is able to take one action and one bonus action. Once each character has taken their actions and/or passed the round ends and the next round begins. In all rounds after the first, everyone acts in the same order as they did in the first round. Characters cycle through this order until the logical end of the encounter or until the GM asks them to make a new initiative roll. The GM can call for new initiative rolls at the beginning on any new round when conditions change.

Since the action moves as a cycle, anything that lasts for a round ends where it started in the cycle. If Wallace uses an ability on an opponent that hinders it defeneses for one round, the effect lasts until Wallace acts again.

Each character can take a single *reaction* per round regardless of whos turn it is.

> Characters do not need to take all their actions in a turn. At any time they may skip or pass their actions. If they do, play continues to the next character.

## Actions

Anything that your character does in a round is an action. It's easiest to think of an action as a single thing that you can do in 6 seconds. Some actions are more a matter of focus than time, such as opening a door and attacking a guard behind it, in which case the GM will rule them to be 2 actions.

Each of your turns in combat you have access to a few different actions. A move action that can only be used during the movement phase. During the Action phase you can make both a standard action and a bonus action in which ever order you choose. Outside of your turn you may make a single reaction each round.

The most common of each action are:

**Move Action**

Move
Charge
Defend
Cast a Long Spell

**Standard Action**

Attack
Cast a standard spell
Finish casting a Long Spell
Delay your action
Do something else

**Bonus Action**

Cast a bonus spell
Activate a special ability (that isn't an attack)
Do something quick

**Reaction**

Take Cover
Intercept
Cast a reaction spell

### Move Actions

During the movement phase of combat each character is given a chance to position themselves in preparation of their action. Having characters all move together before acting has the effect of allowing characters to react to thier opponents and set up teamwork actions.

**Move:** In general the only move action most characters will take is the, aptly named, Move. This gives the character a choice: they can either move an immediate distance -- thus allowing them to reposition -- or they can move a short distance. If they opt to move a short distance they, they may do so but must make difficulty 5 Speed roll. If they pass the roll they only take a standard action during the next phase, if they fail they may only take a bonus action.

**Charge:** A character who has not attacked or been attacked in melee in the past round may charge a target character. If they take the attack action in the next phase their attack is eased by one level.

**Defend:** A character may choose to give up their standard and bonus action for the round and fully defend themselves. Doing so eases any defense rolls they are called on to make by one level.

**Cast a long spell:** Spells with a casting time of long must be started in the movement phase and any costs must be payed.

### Standard Actions

**Attack:** The most common standard action. It allows a character to make an attack or use an ability against a target within range. The character's player rolls the attack against the target's target number. On a hit they deal damage.
**Cast a standard spell:** Spells with a standard casting time can be fully cast as a standard action.
**Finish casting a Long Spell:** Spells that the character began casting during the movement phase complete.
**Delay your action:** A character can delay their action and take it at any other point in the round. Actions delayed past the end of a round are lost.
**Do something else:** An exhaustive list of actions is not practicle. In general this relates to doing any one thing that requires focus and takes no longer than 6 seconds. Opening a door, forcing a lock, searching your pack for an item.

### Bonus Actions

**Cast a bonus spell:** Some spells with the bonus cast time can be cast as a bonus action.
**Activate a special ability (that isn't an attack):** Most non-attack abilities can be activated as a bonus action.
**Do something quick:** As above, an exhaustive list is not practicle. In general this will be something that takes little thought and only takes a second or two.

### Reactions

**Take Cover:** At any time a character may opt to take cover. They may do this in response to an incoming attack. This hinders the next attack against them in the round. Further, if there is cover nearby the character may dive into it, gaining the appropriate condition, otherwise they dive to the ground and are prone. In any event they lose their Standard Action in the next phase.
**Intercept:** The character may make an attack against a target that attempts to leave their reach (i.e. move a short distance away). If the attack hits, no damage is dealt but the target's movement ends. Alternativly, the character may attempt to protect an ally against hostile action from an enemy. The character may make an attack against the enemy, if it hits no damage is dealt but the target's actions against any other character is hindered.
**Cast a reaction spell:** A spell with a cast time of reaction may be cast, if the character is not alrady casting a long spell or has cast a standard spell that round. After casting a reaction spell, the character may only cast a bonus spell this round.

## Damage

When an attack strikes a character, it usually means the character takes damage.

All PCs have a **health pool** that is equal to their second highest stat. For example, if a character has a Might of 9, a Speed of 14, and a Intellect of 17 then that character has 14 health.

An attack against a PC subtracts points from their health pool. When a character's health pool reaches 0 that character is stunned for 1 action and takes a wound. If the character survives their wound, they regain one health on their next action.

NPCs come in two types minions and elites. Minions do not take wounds and die when their health reaches 0. Elites take wounds just like characters, but can only take so many before being incapacitated.

Objects don't have health they have a simple damage track and are either *whole*, *damaged*, or *broken*. Attacking an object may move it down the damage track.

## Armor

Pieces of equipment and special abilities protect a character from damage by giving them armor. Each time a character takes damage. subtract their armor value form the damage before reducing their health pool. 

The most common way to get armor is to wear physical armor, such as a leather jacket or bullet proof vest. All physical armor comes in one of three categories: light, medium, or heavy. Light armor gives the wearer 1 point of Armor, medium gives 2 points, and heavy gives 3 point of Armor.

Some instances of Armor add together, while others don't. In general, all armor gained from different categories is added together. For example, if a character wears medium armor (+2) and has an ability that gives them +1, then their total armor is +3. But if they are wearing medium armor (+2) and attempt to wear light armor (+1) over it, they total is only +2. Essentially, a character can benefit from 1 instance of armor, 1 ability, and 1 temporary magical effect.

Some types of damage ignore physical armor such as Speed or Intellect damage. Ambient damage usualy ignores armor as well.

## Ambient Damage

Some kinds of damage aren't direct attacks against a creature, but they indirectly affect everything in the area. Most of the are environmental effects such as winter cold, high temperatures, or background radiation. Damage form the se kinds of sources is called ambient damage. Physical armor doesn't usually protect against ambient damage.

## Damage from Hazards

Attacks aren't the only way to inflict damage on a character. Experiences such as falling from a great height, being burned in a fire, and spending time in severe weather also deal damage. Although no list of potential hazards could be comprehensive, common examples are included on the table below.

### Damage from Hazards table

| Source        | Damage                                        | Notes                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Falling       | 1 point per 10 feet fallen* (ambient damage)* | -                                    |
| Minor fire    | 3 points per round*                           | Torch                                |
| Major fire    | 6 points per round*                           | Engulfed in flames; lava             |
| Acid splash   | 2 points per round*                           |                                      |
| Acid Bath     | 6 points per round*                           | Immersed in acid                     |
| Cold          | 1 point per round*                            | Below freezing temperatures          |
| Severe Cold   | 3 points per round*                           | Liquid Nitrogen                      |
| Shock         | 1 point per round*                            | Often involves losing next action    |
| Electrocution | 6 points per round*                           | Often involves losing next action    |
| Crush         | 3 points                                      | Object or creature fall on character |
| Hugh Crush    | 6 points                                      | Roof collapse; cave-in               |
| Collision     | 6 points                                      | Large, fast object strikes character |
*ambient damage

## The Effects of taking Damage

When an NPC reaches 0 health, it is dead.

When a PC's health reaces 0 they are stunned and take a wound. The next time they can act, they regain 1 health.

## Wounds

As implied above, simply losing your health cannot kill a character. Wounds, however, can. When a character takes a wound, their player makes a standard 2d12 roll and adds to it the value of any wounds the character already has. This roll has destined effects as normal. Compare the total against the following table to determine which type of wound is taken.

| Roll  | Wound          | Value | Penalty                                      | Example                         |
| ----- | -------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 2-9   | Winded         | 1     | None                                         | Knocked down                    |
| 10-12 | Light Wound    | 2     | Increase effort costs by 1.                  | Graze, abrasion                 |
| 13-15 | Moderate Wound | 4     | All actions hindered.                        | Deep Laceration, Minor fracture |
| 16-18 | Severe Wound   | 6     | Max Health reduced by half.                  | Compound Fracture, organ bruise |
| 19-23 | Critical Wound | 8     | Cannot take actions, max health capped at 1. | Severed artery, crushed limb    |
| 24+   | Death          | -     | Dead                                         | Dead                            |

This means that most characters will be able to take 2-3 wounds fairly safely, but any more and mortality beings to sharply climb.

Thanks to the wonders of Adrenaline characters who are wounded only suffer penalties *after* the encounter in which they are wounded.

## Recoving point in a Pool

After spending points in a Pool, you can recover them by resting. You can't increase a Pool past its maximum by resting -- just back to normal levels. The amount of points you recover from a rest, and how long each rest takes, depends on how many times you have rested so far that day. When you rest, make a recovery roll. To do this, roll d6 and add your level. YOu recover that many points, and you can divide them among your stat Pools however you wish. 

The first time you rst each day, it takes only a few moments to catch your breath; or one action in combat. The second time you rest each day, you must rest for ten minutes to make a recovery roll. The thrid time, you must rest for one hour. The fourth time you rest each day, you must rest for ten hours (usually, this means you stop for the day to sleep and eat).

After that much rest it is assumed to be a new day, so the next time you rest the cycle begins again.

Each character chooses when to make recovery rolls and which ones they are using. If a party of 5 rests for ten minutes because 2 of them want to make recovery rolls, the others don't have to make rolls at that time. Later in that day, those 3 can decide to rest for ten minutes and make their recovery roll.

In addition, recovery rolls can be made in an order (just remember the ten hour recovery ends the day). Thus a character can rest for an hour to make a recovery roll. Then they can recover in combat using their one action recovery and can rest for 10 minutes to recover again.

## Recoving Health and Wounds

A character recovers up to half their health after every encounter. Further, whenever a character makes a recovery roll, they may recover all of their health.

Restoring wounds is more difficult and slower. After each day a character rests they may reduce their least serious wound's value by 1. This means they have to recover light wounds before they can recover moderate wounds and so on. Special power or abilities and medical care can speed up this process.

If you want to know how many days a character must rest to recover their wounds, simply add the value of all their wounds together.

## Special Damage

In the course of playing the game, characters face all manner of threats and dangers that can harm them in a variety of ways, only some of whihc are easily represend by damage.

**Daze and Stunned:** Characters can be dazed when struck on the head, exposed to extremely loud sounds, or affected by a mental attack. When this happens, for the duration of the daze effect (usually one round), all of the character's tasks are hindered. Similar but more severe attacks can stun characters. Stunned characters lose their turn (but can still defend against attacks normally).

**Poison and Disease:** When characters encounter poison they must make a Might defense roll to resist it. Falure to resist can result in points of damage, a wound, or a specific effect such as paralysis, unconsciouness, disability, or something stranger.

Diseases work like poisons, but their effect occurs every day, so the victim must make a Might defense roll each day or suffer the effects. Disease effects are as varied as poisons and many diseases inflict damage that cannot be restored through conventional means.

**Paralysis:** Paralytic effects cause a character to drop to the ground, unable to move. Unless otherwise specified, the character can still take actions that require no physical movement.

**Other Efects:** Other special effectsg can render a character blind or deaf, unable to stand without falling over, or unable to breathe. Stranger effects might negate gravity for the character, transport them to another place, cause them to mutate, os some other strangeness. Each special effect must be handled on a case-by-case basis. The GM adjudicates how the character is affected and how the condition can be alleviated (if possible).

## NPCs and Special Damage

The GM has the final day over what special damage will affect an NPC. Human NPCs usually react like characters, but nonhuman creatures might react very differently.
If an minion NPC is susceptible to an attack that would deal them a wound, using that attack usually kills the minion.

## Cover

If a character is behind cover so that a significant portion of their body is behind something sturdy, attacks agains the character are hindered.

If a character is entierly behind cover (their entire body is behind something sturdy), they can't be attacked unless the attack can go through the cover. For example, if a character hides behind a thin wooden screen with a rifle that can penetrate the wood, the character can be attacked. However, because the attacker can't see the character clearly, this still counts as cover.

## Position

Sometimes where or how a character stands gives them an advantage or a disadvantage.

**Prone Target:** In melee, a prone target is easier to hit (attacks agains them are eased). In ranged combat, a prone target is harder to hit (attacks against them are hindered).

**Higher Ground:** In either ranged or melee combat, attacks by an opponent on higher ground are eased.

## Surprise

When a target isn't aware of an incoming attack, the attacker has advantage. A ranged sniper in a hidden position, an invisible assailant, or the first salvo in an ambush are all eased by two steps. For the attacker to gain this advantage, however, the defender truly must have no idea that the attack is coming.

If the defender isn't sure of the attackert's location but is still on guard, the attacks are eased by only one step.

## Range

In melle, you can attack a foe who is adjacent to you or within reach. If you enter into melee with one or more foes, usually you can attack most or all of the combatants.

The majority of ranged attacks have only two ranges: short range and long range (a few have very long range). Firing beyond your weapon's range hinders the attack by 1 step per additional range up to the maximum range of the weapon. 

**Point Blank:** If a character uses a ranged weapon against a target within immediate range, the attack is eased.

## Illumination

What characters can see (and how well they can see) plays a huge factor in the game. Each brightness has a range. Characters can clearly see any targets closer than that range, are hindered attacking or acting against characters at that range and cannot see any targets beyond that range (treat them as if they were invisible).

**Dim Light:** Dim light is the approximately the amount of light on a night with a bright full moon of the illuminatin provided by a torch, flashlight, or desk lamp. Dim light allows you to see out to short range.

**Very Dim Light:** Very dim light is appoximately the amount of light on a starry night with no visible moon, or the glow provided by a candle. Very dim light allows you to see clearly only within immediate range.

**Darkness:** Darkness is an area with n illumination at all. Targets in complete darkness are impossible to see.

## Visibility

Similar to illuminatin, factors that obscure vision affect combat.

**Lightly Obscured:** A creature who is lightly obscured, as if by fog or mist, is similar to one in dim light. Ranged attacks against such targets are hindered.

**Heavily Obsured:** A creature who is heavily obscured, by deep fog or foliage, is nearly impossible to hit with a ranged attack (treat it was darkness) and even melee attacks are hindered.

**Hidden:** A creature in dense foliage, behind a screen, or behind full cover are hidden and cannot be seen. These creatures cannot be targeted until they are located. Either by searching, using another sense, or some other method.

**Invisible:** Similar to hidden, but an invisible creature cannot be directly located via sight. Even knowing the creature's location is not enough to reliably hit them. Attacks against an invisible creature are hindered by 2 steps.

## Water

Being in shallow water can make it hard to move, but it doesn't affect combat. Being in deep water can make things more difficult and being underwater entirely can seem as different as being on another world.

**Deep Water:** Being in water up to your chest hinders your attacks. Aquatic creatures ignore this.

**Underwater:** For nonaquatic creatures, being completly underwater makes attacking very difficult. Melee attacks with stabbing weapons are hindered by one step, and melee attacks with slashing or bashing weapons are hindered by two steps. Most ranged weapons will not function underwater, attacks with ranged weapons that do function underwater are hindered by one step. Further, weapon ranges are all reduced by one step.

## Moving Targets

Moving targets are harder to hit, and moving attackers have a difficult time as well.

**Ranged attacks and movement:** If you're using a ranged weapon and your target has moved, your attack is hindered by one step per distance the target moved. If you're using a ranged weapon and you moved, your attack is hindered by one step per distance you moved. These penalties can stack. Though the GM may rule they cancel out if both you and your target have moved in the same direction.

**Melee attacks and movement:** In general, making a melee attack against a moving target, or after you have moved does not incure a penalty.

## Special Situation: Area Attacks

Sometimes, an attack or effect affects an area rather than a single target. 

In an area attack, the attacker rolls once and that value is used by all targets to see if they get hit.
