Traits

Partially Submerged. Only the serpent’s head and neck (a 2-square tall target area) are a valid target. Creatures must be adjacent to the water’s edge or have reach ≥4 to make melee strikes against it. Attacks at range greater than 12 squares suffer −2 to their power roll while the serpent is largely submerged.

Submerged Bulk. The serpent can shift up to 6 squares through water (swim) as a move action. It cannot leave water; in shallow pools it can only shift 2 squares.

Gaze of the Deep (Minor) ◆ Intuition RR (target) ◆ Debuff
Distance Ranged 6 · Target One creature

Failure: the target is distracted (−1 to attack rolls) until the end of its next turn. Success: nothing.

Triggered / Reaction

Pull Under (Triggered) — Trigger: a grabbed target starts its turn.
The serpent attempts to drag the grabbed target deeper: target makes a Might RR. On a failure the target is dragged 1 square into deeper water and begins to drown if it cannot breathe there: at the start of each of the target’s turns while submerged and unable to breathe they take 3 damage (save ends). On a success, the target remains grabbed but is not dragged this turn.

Sea Serpent Malice

Hull breaker 7 malice
The sea serpent slams the side of the Hope, throwing all none Risen off balance. All non-Risen gain a bane on action rolls for 1 round, and if A<1 they fall prone and suffer Rip Tide immediately. (Potencey increases by 1 each time this is used).

Rip Tide

The Sea Serpent's movements cover the deck in roiling water. When a character moves, they must make a simple acrobatics roll or stumble, losing 2 squares of movement, if they run out of movement this way they fall prone and risk being pulled into the sea. On the Sea Serpent's turn all prone characters are pulled 2 squares toward the serpent.
