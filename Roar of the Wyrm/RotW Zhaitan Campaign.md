# Name: The Zahitan Awakening
Scope: Campaign

**Core Theme:** The Elder Dragon, Zhaitan, is poised to invade central Arahas to consume its peoples and magics unless heroes arise to stop him.

## **Preamble**

**Summary:**  Twenty years ago the Elder dragon Zhaitan awoke from his torpor and raised the sunken island of Thalorum causing a destructive tsunami that ravaged the coasts of central Arahas. Over the last 2 decades he has quietly built up his forces as he prepared for a full assault of the mainland. Seperately, heroes arise who can challenge him.

> **Twists:** The main thrust of the campaign is fairly straight forward and does not include any major twists.

**Needed Resources:** The Draw Steel Core book, the RotEW GM Setting Document, this document, any supplimentary documents for RotEW.

**Key NPCs:** Zhaitan (Primary Antagonist), Traherne (Sylvari First born)

**Core Conflict & Antagonist's Plan:** Zhaitan wants to consume the magic of all of Arahas. To do so he is raising an army of the dead (both of Thalorum and as a consequence of his Tusnami)

**Main Setting:** Central Arahas (Predominently the Penetint's Reach, Thalorum, XXX, XXX, and XXX)

## **Objectives**

**Hook:** Risen have become an increasingly large problem in the past few years and need to be dealt with. The actual Zhaitan hook will come much later (chapter 7 or so with claw island), the starting hooks will be smaller issues.

**Main Quest:** Defeat Zhaitan and rescue Central Arahas from him.
