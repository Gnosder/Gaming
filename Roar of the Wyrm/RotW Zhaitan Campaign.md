# Campaign Planning

Each level takes 16 victories. I want the game to go up to level 8. Each arc should be a level, so each adventure is ~5 victories. Which makes each arc ~3 adventures. The whole campaign is 8 arcs, 24 adventures, ~48 sessions. Each session will probably be 2-3 victories.

Breakdown:
- Up to level 8
- Campaign covers 8 arcs with 1 level per arc
- Each arc will need 16 victories and should hold 2 longer adventures (6 vic) and 2 raid boss encounters (2 vic)
- Sessions could be ~3 victories; perhaps 1 per hour
- This means 6 sessions per level, 48 sessions for the whole campaign
- The whole campaign can be done in 11 months (with weekly games)
- There are 9 overworld regions. Magumma is for later. Which leaves 1 per level. Should really just give a tast.
