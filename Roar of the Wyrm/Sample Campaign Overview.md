# Campaign Planning

Each level takes 16 victories. I want the game to go up to level 8. Each arc should be a level, so each adventure is ~5 victories. Which makes each arc ~3 adventures. The whole campaign is 8 arcs, 24 adventures, ~48 sessions. Each session will probably be 2-3 victories.

Breakdown:
- Up to level 8
- Campaign covers 8 arcs with 1 level per arc
- Each arc will need 16 victories and should hold 2 longer adventures (6 vic) and 2 raid boss encounters (2 vic)
- Sessions could be ~3 victories; perhaps 1 per hour
- This means 6 sessions per level, 48 sessions for the whole campaign
- The whole campaign can be done in 11 months (with weekly games)
- There are 9 overworld regions. Magumma is for later. Which leaves 1 per level. Should really just give a tast.

9/22/25 - my thinking was flawed. I was giving out 1 victory per scene encounter. This is wrong. It should be 1 victory per combat or major non-combat encounter. It should be 4-6 per adventure (with each ending with a respit) and 3-4 adventures per level. Recalculate:

- Up to level 8
- Echelon 1-3. 1 is level 1-3, 2 is level 4-6, 3 is level 7-9, 4 is level 10
- It covers 3 echelons of 3,3,2 levels. Which means 9-12, 9-12, 6-8 adventures per echelon
- 128 victories all told.

Khoran will show up regardless out of duty, Rytlock will need some convincing to work with Khoran again). Zojja is still in NE and has an idea as to how to help Eir.
5. Thandoril, Rebuilding the Edge, Rytlock went to Thandoril to help, Caithe went with him to talk to him.
