## Continants of Arahs

**Central Arahs:** The place where the RotEW takes place. 5 of the 6 elder dragons call it home. Broken up into 9 regions.

### Penitent's Reach (#\7)

**The Cities of Second Chance (Capital)**

**Rustwater Straits**

[Remember each single zone has 18 full 5-mile hexes and 12 half size; Each zone will have a primary settlement.]

*Special:* Takes up 2 atlas hexes

> *Settlement:* Clay Mouth
>
> *Summary:* Formerly known as Port Mercy and the Clay Pits, this area was flooded by the great tsunami (GT) and turned into a shallow (30-100ft), but wide archipelago. As it is close to the Cities of Second Chance (particularly Graveport) it sees a lot of ship traffic. It's primary settlement is *Clay Mouth* which has been rebuilt (though on higher ground) since the GT.

**Ghostwind Canyon**

**Aether-fire Gultch**

**Moxie's Hope (Mobile Hub)** 

A tall ship converted into a large 'canyon cutter' (able to navigate the rough canyons of the reach and deploy smaller 'landships'). Captained by Second Mate Corbin Hawke after the death of Captain Rosa "Moxie" Keel.

### Thalorum (#\8)

Thalorum, noteably it's capital of Elythion (City of the Gods)
