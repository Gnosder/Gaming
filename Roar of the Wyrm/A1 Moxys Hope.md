# Session 1 of Moxie's Hope

Introduce characters
Respond to distress call, battle Risen Kraken that is attacking the Hope
Assist the repairs of the Hope to get Aqua Gills
Fight way through Risen Kobolds into tide caller's sanctum (where the Kobolds are using Zhaitan's magic to raise undead beasts)
Battle the kraken (phase 1, summoner. Phase 2, tenticles. Phase 3, Underwater kraken fight)

The characters begin in the Rusted Straights of Penetent's Reach. Why? They were on their way to Graveport when they see the Hope under attack from a Kraken. The captain of their transport wants to help, but doesn't know how. His weather mage will help transport them onto the Hope if they want it.

After securing the Hope, they will learn that the Hope was in the area to hunt some Risen Kobolds that were trying to raise a Kraken (and it looks like they did it), the first mate asks the PCs to take their schooner and shut down the kobolds, but they'll need Aqua Gills to do so. The first mate asks the PCs to help with basic repairs (to get the Hope ready to defend itself if needed, or limp to graveport) and will give Aqua Gills in exchange.

The PCs travel to the Tide Caller's Sanctum (which is now underwater) and battle Risen Kobolds before making it to the sanctum propper where they have to kill the ritual channeler and then the Kraken. Learn of a second ritual taking place further off.

The PCs will leave the sanctum to find the Hope. They decided to follow and offer any assistance. END SESSION.

Recap last session and current goal. Describe the Hope and let the explore and meet sailors while the ship is enroute.

The Hope, when their destination is in sight, begins to slow down for, seemingly, no reason. Sailors below deck hear sounds of banging on the Keel armor plates. Risen Kobolds riding Risen Eels are attacking the ship. They slowed it with grapple lines and weights and are trying the break through the armor to get to the hull so they can sink the ship.

The Hope arrives at the Caller's Cove (which is also underwater). They have to solve a puzzle to open the heavy bars that seal the cove. Once inside the cove they can feel magical energy being drawn deeper in the complex (a ritual is in progress). The PCs way is blocked by a large Risen Flame Basalisk (it's blind, but being riden by Kobolds who use it as a mobile platform, it can still belch up molten stone). A Kobold shaman stands on a ledge, protected by a magical ward casting buff magics. After 2 rounds, Caithe appear behind the Shaman and kills him. She'll then assist the PCs.

They will talk to Caithe who will tell them that she is there to stop the ritual. She will go with them to the next chamber.

In the next chamber another Risen Shaman is attempting to reanimate the remains of a Kraken. The PCs interupt them and must prevent the ritual from completing. (The Shaman uses the Kraken tenticles to attack and to protect himself, he is bolstered by the very magic he is using; he is channeling death magic into the kraken, it buffs him).

After the fight, Caithe offers the PCs a place to stay in Graveport while the ship is being repaired (she assumes it's there ship, the first mate doesn't argue).

Rewards: 1 Trinket and 2 Consumables, plus the Moxie's Hope as a Hub. Caithe rep+, Basic Risen Lore, 4 day respite before the next adventure. Offer crafting and research project info.

Session 1 - Abyssal Maw

[In the event that a character building session 0 runs short and you want to start the game, you can begin with the first part of the adventure up until the end of the first encounter. If you do this the second session may run short (the back half of the first session). Add another combat encounter or perhaps a puzzle before the climactic fight.]

"You find yourselves lounging on the deck of a transport ship taking you to the Cities of Second Chance in the Penitent's Reach. The trip thus far has been uneventful and blessed with mild weather. The ship is transporting mostly food stuffs, but a few merchants and some prisoners, their chains cut but left on, round out the cargo. Then there is you. A group of motley adventuers. Everyone can tell that you are different than, stronger than normal folk such as them. The merchant Griston Abernathy, a swarthy dwarf whos is sun kissed and his stony beard the deep blue of the ocean, asks you for your story. Tell us about yourself, he asks, his eyes shining with interest."

The characters should tell the group who they are, what they look like, and why they chose to become an adventurer.

"You enter the recently formed 'Rusted Straights,' once a coastal desert, but now a shallow archeplago with the peaks weather cracked mountains standing tall and lonsome out of the sea. A flare shoots up into the sky from out in the open water, its scarlet brillance looking out of place among the otherwise serene blue sky. 'Flare ho!' The shout comes up from one of the crew and is answered by a commanding barotone from below decks. 'All hands take your general quarters,' the captain orders as he emerges onto the deck , 'helm take us towards that flare.' He turns to you 'Flare like that is an SOS, could be nothing, could be something. We're honor bound by the code to offer whatever support we can. But we have no fighters. If the trouble is pirates or those Risen lizards, we'll have no support to offer. I can't order you to help, but I can ask. Stand with us and stand ready for whatever we find.'"

"When you near the source of the flare you see a ship, it's hull coated in steel and strange pontoons protud from its aft, as another flare scorches out into the air. You see the crew of the strange vessel desperatly trying to repel a half dozen massive tenticles that have emerged from the deep are seem to be attempting to drag the ship into the water. Your captain grits his teeth, 'Full stop. Helm pull us port, and stay away from whatever that is.' He turns to you 'if you're still game to help, this is where you get off. Our weather mage will get you over there.'

"The weather mage summons a gale that launches you off your ship, sending you flying over the watery expanse between the two ships. A soft gust of wind breaks what otherwise would have been a nasty fall and deposits you on the deck of the belegared ship. A call comes out from the defenders. 'Who ever the hell you are, help us get that depth charge over the side.' Prepare for battle."

Encounter 1 -- Attack on the Hope

"As the the second charge detonates the tenticles withdraw and a dark shape moves rapidly away from the ship. A man approahes you, wiping a bloody saber on a burlap cloth, 'I'm Second Mate Corbin Hawke and this beautiful ship you just saved is called Moxie's Hope.'"

Second Mate Corbin Hawke is glad the PCs came and sees them as up and coming heroes which meshes well with the Hope and her purpose. He begins to think they might take over as captain (or at least one of them will).

- State of the ship (bad)
- What the Hope was doing

"'We heard stories of a Risen necromancer or some such trying to wake up the dead leviathans in the straights. We came out here to try and stop 'em from doing that, but, well, seems we're too late. Now the Hopes all busted and in no state to do much more than float, repairs shouldn't take more 'n a day or two though. Still, letting that big beastie get away does rankle me. It'll no doubt heal up and then be out and about wreaking havoc. Unless...' he looks you over 'unless you're willing to go after it."

"You'll need a fast cutter, which we have, and Aqua Gills, which we also have. Only problem, well,' he gestures around him to the ruined upper deck and sagging mast 'we may not be able to get everything you need till we get this cleaned up.'"

Montage Test: Helping the Hope (Low stakes montage; restore recoveries on pass).

"With the hope cleaned up and the cutter ready to go you set sail over the calm blue waters towards what Corbin told you was an old Sea Caller's Shrine, though it's now fully submerged. When you reach the area Corbin told you about, all you see, other than ocean, is a single solitary peak rising up out of the waves. You know the sanctum is below you, the entrance shouldn't be hidden, and foul creatures now call it home."

"You dive down beneath the water, your Aqua Gills allowing you breath as promised. In the still, clear waters of the straight you can see a carved arch, likely the entrance you are looking for, in the distance, perhaps 20 feet below your floating vessel. As you approach the arch you see the entrance covered with an oilly bubble that seems to be holding the ocean back. You push through it, feeling a brief chill from the death magic that holds it together and you enter a dry tunnel leading into the mountain. torches made of bone and with a flickering green flame have been hammered into the wall at various intervals. From what Corbin told you, at the end of the hallway is an antechamer followed by the Tide Caller's Sanctum."

In the antechamber is a number of risen kobolds, they are unaware of the PCs unless they've made a much of noise. The fight will likely start with surprise.

Encounter 2 -- Kobold Guards

"As the leader of the Kobolds falls, the death magic holding the far doors shut fades."

In the next room: "As you enter the chamber you see a Risen Kobold channeling dark magic into a large pool, a dark shape looming at its bottom."

Encounter 3 -- Face the Kraken

"The Krakens lifeless body sinks to the bottom of the sanctuary, it's dark animation stilled. As you emerge from the pool, you hear the sound of running water, as if a wal has sprung a leak." "On the Channelers body you find a map drawn on oiled hide. The map clearly marks your location with a ritualistic symbol. You see a second drawn a ways away from you with both flanking the Cities of Second Chance. Notes in the margin indicate clear intent of a coordinated attack from both positions.

The bubble is starting to break down with the channeler dead. Will still hold for another few minutes.

"As you exit the cave you see a large, steel hulled ship floating in the water next to your cutter." "Once your head breaks the surface of the water you can see that the ship is the Moxie's Hope. The crew greets you merrily as you climb aboard. Second Mate Corbin Hawke greets you warmly 'well met and great job adventurers, we felt that big beastie die from way up here. Lot of death magic came out and went running right back to Thalorum!"

After some celebrating and consideration, Second Mate Corbin Hawke approaches you, a pensive look in his eye. 'You know... with the Captain's passing there has been some debate as to who should take over as capatin of the Hope. You seem like good folk, better than good even. You seem like heroes. I feel in my bones that you're going to be great, that you're going to save a lot of people. Now, I'm not asking you to marry her, but if you wanted to fill in as captain. Well. I could see us following you gladly."

Reward: Unlock the Hope as their hub. Should have 4 victories.
