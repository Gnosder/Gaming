# Ancestries

**Sylvani** A newly birthed race ~10 years. Their white tree is growing south of Thandoril, the second born arose 7 years ago.

**Sumary:** In the vast wilds of the dreaming the Pale Tree awoke. Pods fell from its branches and, as they struck the groud, revealed the Sylvari first born, aware and with knowledge but no memories. Finding near their place a birth a carved stone tablet containing the wisdom of a being called Ventari, the newly awakened Sylvari adopted his wisdom as their own. Many of the first born remembered a dream they had while still slumbering, a dream that drove their action, a *wild hunt*. After a few years passed the Pale Tree bloomed again and new sylvari, the second born, came into the world; from then on, the pale tree was constantly in bloom and more sylvari were born each year.

**Fiction:**

> **Naming:**
>
> **Lifespan:** Unkown as no Sylvari has died of old age.
>
> **Size:** Sylvari are size 1M. Height 4'8" to 5'8" and weight 80-240 pounds.
>
>**Features:** Sylvari are roughly human in size and appearance, though thinner and shorter. Sylvari have plant-like traits such as hard wood for bone structure, foliage and petals for hair, and bark acting as flesh. They glow during the night thanks to luminescent cells in their skin. Sylvari are omnivorous, though they prefer plant based meals, and have fully functions digestive systems (their excrement is similar to mulch). Sylvari are able to photosynthesis, but use it mostly as a "meditative suppliment" rather than a primary nutrition source. Sylvari can feel temperature, but are not affected by non-extreme temperatures. Sylvari can mate and have sex, but they cannot reproduce. Many sylvari can regrow lost limbs and recover from mortal wounds, though such injuries do scar. They have golden blood that moves like sap through their bodies and pollen falls off of them as they move. A sylvari that has not seen the sun in over two weeks begins to wither, though this is mostly cosmetic such Sylvari do become irritabe and belligerant.

**Draw Steel! Traits**

**Signature Trait: Sylvari Origin** 

>Sylvari are plants in addition to their other types. A sylvari under level 3 has fire vulnerability 5. All sylvari are able to regrow lost limbs and recover from near fatal damage (this is done on a timescale of months, but magical healing can speed this up). Thanks to their improved healing a Sylvari only dies when their HP reaches the negative of their full stamina value.
