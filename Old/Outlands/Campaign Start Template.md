## Page 1 -- Pitch and Premise

A good premise describes what the campaign is about. Who are the characters, what are they doing, and why are they doing it?
Part 1 is an elevator pitch. It takes 1-3 sentances max and talks about what the campaign is going to be about.
    "Leaving their provincial lives behind, would-be adventurers team up to seek their fates and fortunes in a fantastic world."
Part 2 how is the game going to actually run and play? What do the sessions and situations look like?
    "The heroes travel through the trackless wild, staying one step ahead of the enemies dogging their trail. Along the way, they encounter obstacles, threats, and people in need. Occasionally, they’ll face hardships or supply shortages or else the enemy will draw close. Those will all serve as the basis for the party’s individual adventures. Between those moments of tension and stress, the party spends long stretches traveling and living off the land. Though they are forced to avoid civilization — where the enemy’s eyes may be watching — small outposts, camps, and isolated settlements provide an occasional respite and chance to interact with the people of the world and to get news of the enemy’s activities."
Part 3 is how the campaign starts. What is the inciting event?
    "The campaign begins when an astronaut is pulled through a rift in space-time during a failed experiment while, simultaneously, the alien prisoners enact their escape plan. Winding up on the same ship, the astronaut and the aliens must escape into an uncharted region of space beyond Imperial borders. Unfortunately, a mole in the group attempts to sabotage their escape."
