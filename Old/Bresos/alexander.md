This is the largest holdfast on contenant. It's made up of 6 smaller cities that were built around the colossus Alexander. Each of the cities was founded by a different Noble house of the Vulpira collective which colonised the island several centuries ago. The 6 houses came together to create the 'Grand Alliance of Alexander' They've spent years fighting against the Yaltans, the giants of Hoarfrost, Pirates of the Dark Sea (a loose alliance of pirates that operates around the island), and a few rebel groups. Since the destruction of Yalt the grand alliance has started to fight more amongst themselves.

## Alexander the Father

The greateset of the colossi and their lynch pin. Was imbued with part of the Walker's divine spark and acts as the primary warden of Cthaat. The Yaltans stole the spark and used it to power their ritual that destroyed Yalt. Since then Alexander has been silent. 
The Circle of Warders has their primary headquarters in Alexanders right cuff. They have most of it mapped and the speaker has the ability to commune with Alexander via its 'brain'.
