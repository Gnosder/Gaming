# Setup

I want to play a pointbuy ttrpg.
Why? less of a power creep (usually) and more agecy in characters, more flexibility
It should be simpler than games like shadowrun. it should have an easy character creation with classes/archtypes as well as recomended options on level up.
Tempo/stophit
Players roll
Fully linear progression

HP to demarcate actual injury
AC and a 'stun' or 'poise' pool that depletes when you get hit and replenishes naturally after not getting hit or after delivering a hit yourself.
Ref, Fort, Will and a 'strain' pool that decreases as things happen and replenishes after resting in a safe place.
