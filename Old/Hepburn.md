the town is pretty quite, until a falling star impacts on the outskirts. The star is a dead outsider that fell from the darklands, it's spear was broken on impact and the release of energy awakened a dormant briar elemental. A faction of wood seekers (sylvans/sylvaneth) wants the spear. The outsider is a celestrial angel killed in battle with the Shadow Titan Dur (Usurper of the Dark, Lord of the Savage Woad, Eater of Regrets). The body of the Angel will begin to evaporate once disturbed leaving only an Astral Shard behind.

Thorn-Moon Seekers:
    Led by Bramble-Lord Crann these seekers want to find and keep otherworldly magic out of the hands of mortals. They fear mortals will use that power to damage nature or disrupt its rhythms.

People don't trust things that fall from the dark, they think its a bad omen (and they're usually right). When the star is seen alarms will go off, the militia will be rallied, the star will impact well before that is done and the town will be put under lockdown. Runners will gather all the folk outside the walls (palisade) and bring them in. All adventurer guild members will be called together to investigate and/or patrol the outskirts. The elemental will rampage through the area at noonish, it will focus on areas that have been cleared of trees (predominately the logging areas), but may venture near town (it's unintellegent and angry). It will leave rampant saplings in its wake that tear up the ground. The Seekers will arrive near dusk and begin tracking the shards; they will stop at nothing to get the shards and if they are overly theatened will attempt to summon a Thorn Avatar.

Loot:
    Astral Shard: A shard of crystalized celestrial essence. Very rare, can be used to cast powerful miricle magic. 6 charges, can cast any miricle or deep healing spell, consumes one charge per level of the spell, vanishes when all charges expended.
    Shards of Celestrial Spear: these shards, if all are found, can be forged back into a spear by a powerful smith. Otherwise, a shard can be grafted/socketed onto a weapon or armor piece to give it enhanced traits. Other uses exist.
    Cran's Horn of Silent Night: When blown the horn emits no sound but spews forth a clinging mist. This mist grants 'pass without trace' to those nearby and lets them see in moonlight as if it were daylight, this benefit lasts until dawn and may only be used at night.
