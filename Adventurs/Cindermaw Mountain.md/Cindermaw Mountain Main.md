# Cindermaw Mountain
A campaign based on Blackrock Mountain from WoW.

Long ago the Dragon Cindermaw was killed and cast deep into the bowls of the mountain that bears his name. A clan of orcs, cast out of their ancestral lands, took up residence in the mountain. Their shaman began to hear the voice of Cindermaw in their dreams and began to dig deeply into the mountain, coming into conflict with the Dwarven clan that lived there. Eventually the dwarves were corrupted by the decendants of Cindermaw who had allied with the orcs to resurect their patron. In an effort to aquire a powerful artifact the orcs attack the town of Redridge a few days from a Human Capital of Stormwind. Heroes arise to assist the Stormwind militia in preserving Redridge and then push forward with a military force led by the spy organization SI:7 to purge the mountain and ensure that Cindermaw never returns.

# Act 1 - Redridge beginnings
Travelling from Elwyyn to Lakeshire pcs encounter Three-Corner's Watch tower as the path forks off towards Duskwood. The guards here direct the PCs to Lakeshire to aid in its defense against the Shadowhide Gnolls and Cindermaw Orcs that threaten it. The gnolls are controllled by the disgraced warlock Morganth. The orcs are led by Gath'Ilzogg.
The flow of the act: Defend Lakeshire, defeat Tharil'zun and his outrunners.  Find a way into Stonewatch keep. Defeat Gath'Ilzogg at the keep and learn of Morganth's betrayal. Storm the Tower of Iigalar and slay Morganth. Bread crumbs point towards Cindermaw mountain and some workings there.
Hook: The charcters are on their way to Lakeshire in Redridge mountains. They've been recruited by agents of Mayor Solomon to assist the town against the orcs and gnolls.
They arrive outside Three corner's watch.
1 - Three-Corner's Watch
A standard 3 story guard tower; training room, barracks, watch tower. Guard Parker is flustered and helpless. He is directing mercenaries and stormwind agents to Lakeshire where Marshal Marris is directing the defense of the town.

2 - Lakeshire
Small town on side of a lake (Lake Everstill). Pretty basic logging/frontier town. Townhall, smithy, pub/inn, houses, dock, fishery. Primary logging and fishing town. Fortifications set up on the roads into town, pallasades around town in good repair.
Marshal Marris, Late 20s but grizzeled, been fighting gnolls all his life. Captain of the town's defense.
- Quest: Attack the gnoll camp to the north and recover the town's stollen supplies. (Salted Meats, preserved vegitables (cabbage and pickels), medicine.)
    "Damn it! We got raided last night... or maybe it was the night before. I haven't slept in 3 days. Listen. some gnolls raided one of our supply sheds and took off with everything. Just like a fart in the wind they were in and they were out. My soldiers saw them running out towards the canyons to the northwest of here. Recover our supplies, I can't spare the soilders."

3 - Redridge Canyons
Steep water carved canyons, limited vegitation. Random Encounters table 3-1. Gnoll Camp (Stealth 8).

3-1 Redridge Canyon random encounters
    Redridge fauna and Gnolls (Sentry, Hunter, Scout)

3a - Gnoll Camp
A dozen gnolls call this temporary camp home. It has a few hide tents, a bone pile, the raid Leader's yurt, a storage tent. Inside the raid leader's yurt is a missive written in Gnollish (3-2)

3-2 Gnoll Missive
A crudely written missive written in the Gnoll language out of charcoal.
    "Raid the humans at night. Take their food. Hide in canyon. Yeenoghu sate you. - Yowler"

4 - Lakeshire
Turn in quest
    Marshal Marris: "Well done. Honestly I wasn't sure you could pull it off, but here you are! See Mayor Solomon for your reward, he's at teh townhall." "I can't read that chicken shit that gnolls call writing, but the mayor can and this looks important -- I feel it in my bones."

Mayor Solomon "So Marris roped you into recovering our supplies did he? Well I'm glad you made it back in one peice. Gnoll activity has tripled over the past few weeks and it's no longer safe outside of town. Say, since you helped out before would you be willing to keep helping? Our guards are streched thin just protecting the town and reinforcements from the capital are still at least a week out. I need people to figure out what the gnolls are planning." [If the missive is given to him] "Yowler? Yowler?! We keep killing gnolls named Yowler. I don't know how many sons the original Yowler had, but it's got to be close to a hundred. Looks like we've got another Yowler to kill. We need to find him, kill him, and see if he has anymore invasion plans, I fear this is worse than it seems." "If I had to guess he'll be somewhere at the far north end of the canyons. Take care not to run into any gnoll hunting parties"

(If the missive is not recoverd a hunter gives the mayor another one he got off a gnoll he killed)

Reward for helping Marris: Coin plus extra for the missive

Quest Yowler must die (again)!

5 - Redridge Canyons
Steep water carved canyons, limited vegitation. Random Encounters table 3-1. Gnoll Camp has been abandoned. Gnoll hunting parties still patrol to the north end of the canyons and they are on edge.

5-1 Redridge Canyon random encounters
    Redridge fauna and Gnolls (Sentry, Hunter, Scout)

5a - Yowler's Pack
On a rise at the north end of the canyons where the river Campford begins at the base of a falls there is a semi-pemanent gnoll encampment. 4 dozen gnolls call it home including 2 dozen cubs (there are no elderly and even nursing mothers are dangerous). The largest yurt is Yowler's home and war room. A black skinned orc lived among the gnolls acting as an abassador for the cindermaw clan. In Yowler's yurt are the cindermaw war plans.

5-2 Missive to Yowler from 
In Gnollish written in charcoal on hide.
    "The orcs of the Cindermaw Clan are feeder brothers. Devour the humans by night. Gather a feast and be ready for a great moot. Yeenoghu sate you. - War Leader Fangore"

5-2 Cindermaw War Plans
Written in Orcish on hide using charcoal
    "With the help of the Shadowhide army we will destroy the humans of Lakeshire and lay siege to their capital. Glory to Cindermaw! - Gath'Ilzogg"
    Has further plans detailing raids and then an assault on lakeshire.

6. Lakeshire
Turn in quest
    Mayor Solomon "Good work killing Yowler. Did you find anything else at the camp?" "Shadowhide army!? Damn those orcs to hell! These invasion plans speak of a massive build up of orcish and gnoll forces in the east. Looks like Gath'Ilzogg, the Cidermaw general, is preparing to march his armies across Lakeshire and attack the capital directly!" "We're finished! I might as well call for an evacuation now and clear out Lakeshire before the orcs march. Unless..." "John Keeshan, a veteran of several wars with the Orcs, is living at the Inn. He says he's retired, but -- we need him. And we need you. We don't have the soldiers to contend with an army, but you've proven you can get things done. With Keeshan with you you'll be able to sneak through their ranks and kill their leaders."

    John Keeshan - "I'm done fighting. I've seen to much, done too much." "I know about the gnolls, they're dangerous to hunters, but not to this town." He can be persuaded by mentioning the impending army and invasion. "Fine. I'll help you. Head back to the docks and wait for me by the Jade, my riverboat. I need to get my things and I'll meet you there." At the boat "I have to warn you. A small group like us, going up against an army, you're going to see some things you'll wish you hadn't. You'll have to become someone you wont like, trust me, I know." "There's an old hunting camp across the lake, we'll set up there."

7. Camp Everstill
An old hunting camp hidden in the foliage around the lake. If John hadn't been with you, you'd have gone right past it.

    Keeshan "Normally this area is a rich hunting ground, but the gnolls have been more active lately so its been abandoned. There's an old fort to the north that Orcs will probably be using as a staging ground, but I'm willing to bet they've been staging in the Valley to the south as well. We'll check there first. The valley is also home to a handful of locals, if they're still alive, they'll likely need our help."

Quest - First Blood
    Scout the area, find the locals, return to Keeshan BEFORE assaulting the orcs.

8. Redridge Valley
A forested valley with many meadows. Heavily populated by deer and other game. There are no longer many predetors as the gnolls have chased them out.

8a - Valley Lodge
A hunting lodge frequented by locals, it has been burned to timbers. Signs of a struggle are evident and a chared deer skullhas been mounted on a post outside the ruins, the calling card of the Cindermaw.

8b - Valley Fort
A simple collection of one roomed houses arranged in a circle with a rough wooden palisade around it. The buildings have been burned and there are blood stains in the dirt around the compound.

8c - Forester's Hut
A simple one room hut that has been hidden by foliage and fortified. 3 Families have gathered together to protect it.
    Forester "The orcs have been capturing anyone they come across and burning their homes. The fort fell early on. We've tried to get word to Lakeshire, but the Gnolls have set up a blockade between the Valley and town. The orcs are taking the captives to the old Forester's Tower by Shalewind valley. Brannigan Duke said they had a dragon with them that turned into a human, but he got captured a few days ago and no one else has seen it."

8d - Render's Valley
If Keeshan has been looped in "We need to rescue those civillians before we can deal with the orcs. Your best bet is to sneak in at night to free them. After that... I made these explosives out of... don't worry about it. They're high yield and should make short work of that orc camp and all those charred tusk heads. Plant the charges around the camp and below the tower." They're vaugly magical and made from scrap and body parts. Messner taught him, kind of.

A fortified orc camp built in a clearing near the forester's tower. Orcs patrol the area. They are forcing the captives to build fortifications for them. The camp is overseen by Overseer Dratrig. The captives are held in pens at night. They have seen Grand Magus Doane dealing with the orcs and leading the gnolls. Brannigan is dead, but he said that Doane can turn into a black dragon.

8x - Detonation
If the charges have been placed Keeshan allows the party to detonate them. They're significantly stronger than Keeshan let on and turn the orc camp into a crater. There are no survivors.

9 - Camp Everstill

    Keeshan "Doane. I know that rat. He was a mage from the capital. Tried to brand me a war criminal, tried to say I was too violent, that not even orcs deserved me. The hypocrite. The traitor. He thinks he can lead the gnolls and orcs against us? Let's show him just how violent I can be." "There's a mage's tower just north of the valley overlooking a small lake. It used to be used by the disgraced mage Morganth some years ago. I'm willing to bet Doane moved in and made himself at home. It also happens to be within spitting distance one of the Gnoll's hunting ground, Galardell Valley. Let's go scout it out."

10 - Galardell Valley
Gnoll totems adorn trees in the area, this is clearly their territory. The tower of Ilgalar is at its south western edge. The area around the tower is warded and requires a key to access safley. The key is held by the gnoll shaman Fangor who is raising fallen gnolls into Witherlings to support the Shadowhide. She is isolated, but not undefended. At the tower, Doane summons a Void Demon and flees rather than reveal himself.

11 - Stonewatch Keep
Capture an orcish siege engine and use it to blast a hole in the keep's wall and stave off an orc counter attack. Enter the keep and kill the Cindermaw leadership and exfiltrate before the horde can figure out what you're doing. Keeshan will stay with the siege engine and keep the horde distracted as best as he can. Tharil'zun is in the keep, but Gath'Ilzogg is on a hill to the south of the keep attempting to summon Darkblaze. When Gath'Ilzogg dies a black dragon appears on the horizon when it lands on the hill it transforms into the Magus Doane.

12 - Lakeshire 
Victory! But wait... there's more. The Cindermaw are getting bolder and with aid from the black dragon flight they are dangerous. The party is sent to the burning steps to see what they are up to.
