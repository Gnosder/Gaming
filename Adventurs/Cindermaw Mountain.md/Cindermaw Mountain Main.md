# Cindermaw Mountain
A campaign based on Blackrock Mountain from WoW.

Long ago the Dragon Cindermaw was killed and cast deep into the bowls of the mountain that bears his name. A clan of orcs, cast out of their ancestral lands, took up residence in the mountain. Their shaman began to hear the voice of Cindermaw in their dreams and began to dig deeply into the mountain, coming into conflict with the Dwarven clan that lived there. Eventually the dwarves were corrupted by the decendants of Cindermaw who had allied with the orcs to resurect their patron. In an effort to aquire a powerful artifact the orcs attack the town of Redridge a few days from a Human Capital of Stormwind. Heroes arise to assist the Stormwind militia in preserving Redridge and then push forward with a military force led by the spy organization SI:7 to purge the mountain and ensure that Cindermaw never returns.
