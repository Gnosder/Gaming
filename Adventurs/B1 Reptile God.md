# B1 -- Against the Cult of the Reptile God

A port of the classic adventure.

BASIC level: means this adventure is best for newish adventurers.

## Adventure Summary

Before the adventure begins when a naga, Explictica Defilus, takes over a ruined temple near the town of Orlane and begins to mind control the villagers to serve him.

As rumors begin to swirl of the strangeness that has gripped Orlane, a group of adventurers arrive there.

The adventurers are presented with the town and its strangeness. Eventually they uncover the cult that lives there and tracks them to their home temple.

They traverse the wilderness and brave its dangers to get to the temple.

They delve into the ruins of the temple to rescue vilagers and combat the cult's dark master.

The adventure plays in 2 acts with a short interlude to connect them.

## The Adventure

#### Considerations

AtcotRG is a straight forward adventure that begins as a mystery and turns into a dungeon crawl.

The mystery portion has lite horror elements.

This advnture is written to be system agnostic. Portions of the text will have blanks provided where you are able to write checks/DCs for situations. Appendix A has a list of adversaries, treasures, and items that should be ported. Appendix B and subsequent appendicies will have the list ported into a few common systems.

#### Hooks

Possible reasons for the characters to go to orlane are:

They were hired by a guild or lord to investigate the town. Pay _______

They heard the rumors and decided to investigate.

They arrived in town while traveling and get caught up in the mystery.

### Act 1 - Orlane

This act covers the exploration of Orlane and discovery of the Cult. It begins as soon as the characters enter the town and ends when they leave the town *in pursuit of the Cult*.

#### What people Know

In Orlane
    Orlane used to be fairly prosperous but has recently become more closed off. Trade has stagnated, townsfolk have become distrustful. Some townfolk have gone missing but most return a few days later acting strangly (but its more of a feeling). A few have yet to return.

Outside Orlane
    Rumors have been swirling. Orlane has cut off trade, and villagers no longer travel to surrounding towns. Travelers have gone missing near the town.


#### Cult Activities

The Cult of the Reptile God has a few priorities in the town that they will pursue. They are, roughly in order:
    Remain hidden (For as long as possible)
    "Recruit" more cultists. They prioratize outsiders and vagrants.
        They do this by kidnapping people and taking them to the Naga to be charmed.
    Spread the Influence of the Cult beyond Orlane
        They do this by "recruiting" dignitaries and others from outside places.

#### Orlane Outskirts

"The forest you are traveling in opens up into a small rolling grassland. A few farms are visible on either side of a packed dirt road. A weathered sign post points down the road and says simply "Orlane". A few bored goats graze in a large pen near the main road and a large lizard is sunning itself on a stone near the pen."

The farms are all walled off by chest high stone walls. Houses can be seen a little ways past them (11). A small cluster of buildings can be seen down the road (there are 13 buildings in the town, but only 8 can be clearly seen).

The road leads directly past 3 houses.

GM Note: The lizard is a member of the cult (charmed) and will telepathically report the character's movements to the naga.

#### Graven's Dairy

"The first house you see is clean and well maintained whitewashed building with an equally clean barn beyond it. Several cows chew their cud in front of the barn and 3 little playing in the yard stop to gawk at you as you walk past."

The girls are too young to be afraid, but there is a good chance their older sister will see the characters and rush out to usher the girls inside. **Nowel Graven** is likely to meet anyone that comes onto his land. He's friendly and kind. If his insticts tell him the characters are trustworthy he might invite them in for tea and cheese. He is concerned about what is happening in Orlane, but doesn't know much about it. He lives with his wife, mother-in-law, and his 5 daughters.


#### Burned House

The second house is nothing but a pile of charred wood. It's clear a fire destroyed the home some what recently.

GM Note: The house was burned down by cultists.

#### The Twaine Home

The final house you see before the town is a simple wooden building surrounded by an attractive flower garden with a small barn beyond it. A teenage girl is churning butter on the porch, when she sees the group she runs into the house. Shadowy form are visible behind the curtains.

**Hewitt Twaine** and his 2 sons will watch the characters through the curtains while his wife and daughter hide in the curtains. If spoken to Hewitt will do all the talking. He is polite, but quite. He understands that his town has changed, but does not know why. He does not trust outsiders and will not let them into his home for any reason.
