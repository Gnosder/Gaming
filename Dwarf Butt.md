# Kaza Mightfist fromerly of the Tinstone Clan (Dwarf Butt)

An ascetic monk dwarf with frightfully low charisma.

# Kaza Mightfist Backstory

Kaza grew up on the fringe of dwarven society, mocked for his awkwardness and relentless habit of interjecting with mangled idioms he believed were wise and timely. The other children called him “Dwarf-Butt” — a name he pretends not to remember but still winces at when drunk.

The final straw came when he was accused of defiling a clan heirloom. In truth, he had merely tried to clean the blood off a dusty old ceremonial axe, but the damage — to the artifact or to his reputation — was done. The elders exiled him, muttering that his tongue was sharper than his fists.

Kaza retreated to a tiny cave in the mountains, seeking enlightenment. He meditated, punched boulders, and survived on mushrooms and dripping water. He thought he was alone for a decade; in reality it was only eight months. Time does strange things in the dark.

When he emerged, Kaza believed he had attained wisdom. In reality, he’s still the same blunt, literal, socially inept dwarf — only now he thinks his every utterance is profound. As he likes to say, often while sober and staring intently at someone’s navel:

> “A cracked mug still holds ale if you're thirsty enough!”

Kaza now wanders the world, convinced he’s spreading enlightenment, but mostly just confusing taverns full of strangers.

## 🪓 Kaza’s Signature “Wisdoms”

### “Philosophical” Sayings

* “The mountain teaches patience… then drops a rock on your head.”
* “Better to punch first and ask later than to never punch at all.”
* “When the tunnel is dark, chew louder.”
* “A cracked mug still holds ale if you’re thirsty enough.”
* “Silence is golden — but so is beer.”

### Weird Toasts / Battle Cries

* “Stone skin, iron fists!”
* “Deep tunnels, deep fists!”
* “Drink deep, hit hard!”
* “May your beard catch no embers!”

### Oddball Compliments / Greetings

* “Your knuckles look well-seasoned.”
* “You smell like a successful dig.”
* “Ah, symmetry! The gods’ second-best gift.”
* “I’d bow, but the floor isn’t worthy.”

### Random Exclamations (instead of swears)

* “By Moradin’s cracked mug!”
* “Stone and silence!”
* “Khaz-bok!” (nonsense dwarven word)
* “Hammer and chisel!”

---

### How to Use Them

* **Pick one per scene** and lean into it until it gets a chuckle, then retire it.
* **Mix “philosophical” + exclamation** for bonus comedy: “Stone and silence! The mountain teaches patience… then drops a rock on your head!”
* **Rotate through greetings** in taverns or at gates; it makes Kaza feel unpredictable but consistent.

### 1. The Quirk: “Cave Hermit Tourette’s” (but game-friendly)

You can mimic the *energy* of the bartender without actually playing an offensive caricature of Tourette’s. Instead of real-world tics, do **“philosophical blurts”** or **“old dwarven curses”**:

* Randomly mutter half-remembered proverbs (“Silence is golden—unless it’s the gold of a dragon’s hoard!”).
* Cough out a nonsensical dwarven word when startled (“Khaz-bok!”).
* End sentences with monk aphorisms (“…and thus the mountain crumbles, eh?”).

This scratches the same itch as the bartender but stays respectful and game-appropriate.

---

### 2. Mangled Idioms: “Dwarfish Wisdom”

Write a little list of warped sayings you can pull from, e.g.:

* “Kill two kobolds with one slingstone.”
* “The mithril isn’t always shinier on the other side.”
* “You can’t mine a mountain without cracking some skulls.”
* “A hammer in the hand is worth two in the forge.”

Every time you roll poorly on a social check, toss one out.

---

### 3. Socially Awkward Habits

Pick one or two and stick to them:

* Avoids eye contact, stares at people’s foreheads instead.
* Hands out unsolicited “ascetic living” tips (“You’d sleep better on a stone floor.”).
* Compliments weird things (“Your ears… nicely symmetrical.”).

---

### 4. Give the Party an “Out”

Have your dwarf *defer* in situations where charm is needed. Example:

> *PC:* “We need to convince the guard to let us through.”
> *You:* “I’ll just stand back here polishing my knuckles while you do the talking.”

This keeps the humor without blocking the game’s progress.

---

### 5. Physical Comedy

* Misjudge surface customs — bows too low and tips over.
* Accidentally breaks fragile items with his monk grip.
* Brings a meditation cushion everywhere and sits cross-legged in inappropriate places (like on the bar).

---

### 6. Sample One-Liners

* “Ah yes, as the old hermit said: ‘Patience is a virtue, but ale is faster.’”
* “I don’t get your joke, but you’re laughing, so I’ll bow.”
* “Your beard is magnificent. Oh. You’re a woman. Still magnificent.”
