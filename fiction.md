"Cassandra Kane, so good of you to come to this gods forsaken place. Too bad you wont be leaving." The voice was deep, proud, and thickly accented. It seemed to slither through the ruined crags of the cavern; its reverberations made it all the more sinester, Cas looked up from her map, toggling off the red light she was reading it by and cursed silently to herself.

"Malik, I thought the air smelled more foul than it should have. I appriciate you talking before shooting this time." She glanced around in the darkness of the cavern, looking for any light to betray his location. She saw none.

"If the air is sour, you have only yourself to blame. I'm not even on the same continent as you. No, I finished in that place long before you arrived and made sure to leave some-- presents for you. Though it's a pitty to destroy such a rare archeological marval as that place. Perhaps you could do me one last favor and kill yourself for me. Spare the poor ruins the ignomity of such a callos end."

Cas cursed again, aloud this time, as she glanced back the way she had come. Malik had no reason to lie, and planting explosives was well within his nature. There was nothing for it but to try and stall him long enough to get out. 

"So that's how it's going to be, is it? After all our adventures you'd rather end it all in a fireball than in person. I wonder, though, if you've found the key to the cypher yet? Or perhaps I'm the only one." She moved slowly as she talked, gingerly picking her way through the jagged, waist high crags. She could only hope her bluff could buy her the time she needed.

"Really? That's your play? I'm not sure if you've heard, but computers are astonishingly good at cracking codes. I doubt an ancient cypher such as this will give them much trouble and without you hounding me I'll have all the time I need to break it. Have you given any thought to my offer or are you just stalling to give yourself a chance out? Gods know we did that enough, it never ceased to amaze me that it worked so reliably." 

"What's your game, Malik, if you just wanted me dead you'd have done it by now 'archaeological marvel' or not." She didn't slow down, but she was getting concerned. Malik didn't talk this much unless... unless she knew something he didn't. She wracked her brain, reviewing all the clues and breadcrumbs. She had thought the cypher was the last part of the puzzle. Well, that and actually getting the scroll, but that point seemed moot now.

"That's your problem, Cassandra, you never saw this as a game. To you it was an obligation, an obsession. It was always so serious. What is it you always said? 'Discovering the past to save the future?' Gods, how pompass. Still, I suppose that drive served us well, until you didn't need me anymore that is. I always wondered, how it felt to betray such an old friend."

"Is that what this is about? Malik, you were dead. I checked your pulse. Hell,I hit you with a defib even though I knew it wouldn't work. What more did you want from me? Blackbeard had the gourd, and we had both agreed about how important it was to get it back."

"I know, I know. You really did everything you could and more. You were a good partner. It's not your fault that I turned heel and you're not the only one that can stall. Goodbye, Cassandra."

Cas was only halfway back across the cavern when the first charge blew and filled the cavern with an intense flash of light. The detonation was deafing, so much so that it completely drowned out the cascade of rock and earth that followed it. In moments the only entrance to the cavern was completly buried and once again darkness filled the room. Two heartbeats later the other charges began to blow, each further away than the last. Muffled blasts from behind the new cave-in, destroying the tunnel to the cavern one segment at a time. Cas counted 7 blasts before silence returned to the cavern.

The air was swirling with dust, thick with the smell of gunpowder and earth. She ignited her torch, filling the cavern with light and revealing the damage. The way out was thouroughly closed. A mountain of rocks where the tunnel once was.
