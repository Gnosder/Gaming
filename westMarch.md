# West Marches

Go westward brave adventuerer!

The frontier is upon us. Several years ago a selfish mage caused a planar overlay which wiped out the whole of the western ocean and covered it over with a strange new land. At first storms and magical interferance kept anyone from exploring this new land, now the Alliance has found a way through the storms and has begun to explore. You... are not alliance. A private group has 'aquaired' their own way through and have hired you to help them explore. There's enough to go around, right?

### Setting Notes

The area is called the Outlands. The first place is a wasteland of crag rock called the blasted land. Outlands is a hex crawl.
The groups at play are the Yanai Alliance and the Consortium -- which is the group who hired the players.
The starting outpost is called 'Hope's Gambit'

### Game Notes

## The Outlands

The result of a planar overlay brought about by the mad Mage Efiltorias Dras Krall Etalmedica. No one knows what plane the land came from, or really anything about it. Any intel that existed went up in the same fireball that killed the mage.

### Hope's Gambit

This small outpost has been set up by the consortium as a base on the 'Outlands'
The outpost will grow and level up with the players.

### The Blasted Land

A desolate wasteland of crag rock once called Valley of the Guardian. The area was once part of the nearby forest until a mage of that land preformed the same spell Efiltorias did, at the same time no less.

### Halfpine Forest



### The Black Moras

A swampy marsh
