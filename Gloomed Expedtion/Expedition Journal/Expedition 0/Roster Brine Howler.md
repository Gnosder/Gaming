Field Primer Entry: Brine Howler
Compiled by Edrin Voss, Expedition 0, Natural Biologist

Summary:

The creature we are colloquially calling the Brine Howler is a grotesque, predator believed to be a Gloom-corrupted descendant of some unknown species. While their physiology hints at some greater past, they now bear little resemblance in mind or manner to an intelligent species. Their current form is best understood as a product of both natural devolution and unnatural Gloom influence. Simply put; they are a grotesque amalgum of a Crocodile and a Gila Monster with the strategic sense of a wolf pack and advanced, almost sentient, deceptive nature.

Morphology & Appearance:

Brine Howlers are semi-aquatic quadrupeds with a bulky, low-slung posture and evident adaptations for ambush predation. A typical adult measures 9–12 feet from snout to tail and weighs upward of 800 pounds when bloated with brine.

• Dermis: Pitted, patchy scales give way to sloughing flesh around joints and gills. The back is armored with bony ridges and jagged dorsal spines—likely vestigial.

• Eyes: Pale and faintly luminescent, fixed forward with a predatory gaze. Optical responses suggest limited depth perception on land but excellent tracking underwater.

• Mouth: The lower jaw splits into two hinged mandibles when fully unhinged, revealing a secondary jaw structure within—a raking maw suited for tearing, not chewing.

• Limbs: Forelimbs are long and powerfully muscled, terminating in webbed claws. Hindlimbs are shorter, more paddle-like. Locomotion is ungainly on land but exceptionally fluid in water.

• Vocalization: Their signature croaking howl carries for miles along shorelines, particularly before or during storms. While previously assumed to be a mating call or warning, I have observed instances of mimicry—reproducing cries for help, gull calls, and even the faint tolling bell of buoys. This appears entirely reflexive and not communicative.

Observed Behavior:

 Brine Howlers are not territorial in the traditional sense but will aggressively defend nesting grounds and brackish lairs. Packs (3–7 individuals) operate with alarming coordination, suggesting rudimentary instinctual hierarchy or pheromonal cues.

• Nesting: Construct crude depressions from driftwood, refuse, and the bones of prey—typically in sea caves, tidal ruins, or below derelict piers.

• Feeding: Carnivorous and opportunistic. Favor ambush tactics—striking from beneath docks or surf. Documented behavior includes dragging victims into the shallows for mauling.

• Activity Patterns: Mostly nocturnal or crepuscular. Aggression spikes during high tide and following major Gloom surges.

• Tool Use / Memory: No sign of retained sentience or abstract reasoning. However, individual specimens display pattern learning (e.g., avoiding known harpoon angles or feinting retreat to bait traps).


Threat Assessment:

 Extremely High.

Brine Howlers represent a severe and persistent danger to any coastal operation, particularly small settlements or trade harbors.

• Shipping Lanes: Capable of capsizing small vessels via coordinated strikes from below. Will swarm ships at anchor. Vocal mimicry may lure expeditioners to the water’s edge.

• Infrastructure: Weaken docks and piers with constant burrowing and nesting behavior. Haunt estuaries and brackish rivers vital to inland supply.

• Expedition Threat: We lost over a dozen expeditioners in initial engagements. We've seen them move as far as a mile inland during heavy rain.

• Response to Lucent Fire: Once we relit the fire the Brine Howlers retreated out of its area. While the immediate area is secure, they still pose a threat to incoming expeditions.

Recommendation:

 Establish strict no-anchoring zones near known nesting waters. Harbors must be lit and patrolled throughout the night. All routes along the coast should include armed escort. Under no circumstances should anyone respond to voices near the water after dark.
Should population pressure increase, coordinated purges with fire and blessed weapons may be necessary.
