Field Primer Entry: Gloom Wisp
Compiled by Edrin Voss, Expedition 0, Natural Biologist

Summary:

A will-o-wisp corrupted by the Gloom. Non-intelligent, but possessed of some malevolent intent; Gloom Wisps attempt to lure their prey into other, stronger Gloom corrupted creatures and locations.

Morphology & Appearance:

Gloom Wisps appear as a mote of bright light ranging in color from white  to pale blue and green with a blackish purple center.

Observed Behavior:

Gloom Wisps have been seen appearing off in the distance at night or indoors. They do not stay close enough for physical interaction preferring to blink away. During hostilities with other creatures they tend to appear around the perimeter of the combat luring and charming Vital creatures into dangerous areas.

Limited supernatural charm-like effects have been documented. Gloom Wisps are able to charm weak willed or distracted targtes into moving towards them, often into danger.

Threat Assessment:

 Low Threat

However, their existence implies that stronger creatures or concentrations of Gloom are nearby. Caution should be exercised when they are seen. Gloom Wisps are never the most pressing threat in the area.

Recommendation:
Take caution around Gloom Wisps and remain alert for other threats.
