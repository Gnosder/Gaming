 New Sea Breeze 

The ruins of the costal city of Sea Breeze houses the headquarters of the Expeditionary Forces of Light in the Old World. While it starts small, it will gradually grow over time; offering more perks to expeditions.  Finalize campaign rules 


Locations within the city are: 

First Step Docks – Constructed by E0 to allow larger expedition craft to dock. 

The Greater Lucent Fire – Stoked by a Lucent Spark, it weakens the Gloom in the hex (This does not apply to areas with a Gloom Blossom or heavy concentration). Any Lucent Fires connected to this hex are immune from degradation. 

The Wayfinder – The flagship of E0 that was grounded and turned into living quarters and offices, the unofficial HQ of the EoL. 

Look Out Point – A squat stone tower on a cliff above New Sea Breeze that acts as a lighthouse. 

 

Unbuilt, but planned locations within the city are: 

The Beacon – planned to be the official HQ of the EoL and will enable expeditions to send out away missions. 

The Yard – planned to be the industrial hub of the city, home to craftsmen of the guild. 

The Gloom Resistant Store House – Using experimental methods dreamed up by E0 to resist the gloom, will prevent supplies from degrading while out in the mist. 

Port Mercy – a planned hospital. Morale loss from losing vitality is decreased. Any time 5 or more vitality is lost in a single instance, there is a 50% chance to reduce that loss by 1. 

Second Wind Docks – Allows for ships to leave the old world to transport found items and wounded back to Lustera.
