# Character Creation 

 

Building characters is also fairly straight forward, see the Cypher system core rule book for information. The following are available options to choose from.

A simple way think of character creation is to understand the basic character statement: "I am a [adjective] [noun] who [verb]." 

e.g. I am a gritty warrior who masters weapons or I am a cunning mage who masters magic. 

 

In this statement the adjective, also known as a descriptor, speaks to how your character does things. The noun, also known as your type or class, determines what you are; and the verb, also known as your focus, determines what you can do and what is special about you. When building a character you will choose an option for each of those sections. While there is no definitive list (we can make anything you want that doesn't appear here) shown below is the short list of what exists. If an option is in a published book but does not appear below, just ask. 

## Verb, the Foci 

 

First, and backwards from how it appears in the statement, are the foci. These are listed first simply because they are awesome and often have the greatest impact on what your character can do.

## Noun, the Type or Class 

 

There are 4 different base classes, but all can be flavored to help mix them into new class. Below is a list of fantasy classes and their corresponding types and Flavors.

The 4 base classes are Warrior, Adept, Explorer, and Speaker and 4 flavors: Stealth, Magic, Combat, and Skills and Knowledge. 

Warriors – Skilled fighters, they often deal and take the most damage. 

Adept – A mage or mentalist who masters powers outside the understanding of others. 

Explorer – Hardy and skilled and willing to bravely face the unknown 

Speaker – A talker whos as good with people as they are with words 

Stealth Flavor – Good for characters who are good at sneaking, infiltrating, and deceiving others 

Magic Flavor – A good way to add some basic magic to a class, not for full casters (see Adept for those), but good for partial casters 

Combat Flavor – Makes a character more martial, great to give a fighting edge to an otherwise non-combat character 

Skills and Knowledge Flavor – For those who understand that Knowledge is power, not flashy but always useful. 

 

## Adjective, the Descriptors 

 

Your descriptor defines your character – it flavors everything you do. Take, for example, the difference between a charming explorer and a vicious explorer. Without even know stats and number you can tell that the two will play very differently.

## Mundane Equipment 

 

In general individual items are not tracked. Instead supplies are expended when an item is needed. For example if a torch is needed, 1 supply can be spent to outfit the expedition with torches. These supplies will last for an amount of time specified by the GM (1 action, 1 exploration turn, 1 watch, etc.) based on what makes sense in the narration. A short list of examples and their supply costs is shown below. 

 

Most items only cost 1 supply, this may seem steep for some items, but it is best to remember that: 1. Spending the cost outfits the entire expedition (or at least all those who need it) and 2. When you need something you need it now and don't have time to be precious about the price.

## Cyphers 

 

One-use consumable items with powerful effects. There are many types and do many things. A few examples are listed below, but it is not a complete list. Each character can only carry so many at a time (usually between 2 and 4), so it's worth using them. 

 

## Artifacts 

 

Similar to the magic items of DnD. These powerful relics have persistent, but not unlimited effects. Magic items have been damaged by the Gloom and will eventually deplete their magical energy. Unless otherwise stated, artifacts can be recharged, though doing so might be difficult. 

Depletion – Each artifact will have a depletion roll listed (e.g. 1 in 20); every time the artifact is used a depletion roll is made and, should the roll come up the indicated result, the item runs out of charge. Finalize campaign rules
