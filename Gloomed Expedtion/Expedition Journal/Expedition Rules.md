## Expedition Core Stats and abilities 

 

Each expedition has 3 core stats, up to 4 named expeditioners (these are different from PCs) and each can have a number of abilities, perks, and flaws, and a number of Key abilities (unlocked through play) 

 

The stats are: 

 

Vitality: This number typically starts at 100 and denotes the overall life of the expedition. It can be assumed that vitality represents the actual number of expeditioners left alive, however it is intentionally left somewhat abstracted. As the number drops it can be assumed that people are dying. When vitality reaches the following break points 75%, 50%, 25%, one of the named expeditioners as well as their perks are lost; their flaws, however, remain. When vitality reaches 0 the expedition ends. Vitality can only decrease and will never go up. 

Morale: A measure of how enthusiastic and determined the expedition is. Is rated from 0-100, it serves as a shield against some vitality damage and provides bonuses (for high morale) or penalties (for low morale) to expedition actions (such as Missions, Salvaging, Exploring, etc.) and vitality loss. Morale can both increase and decrease. It has a resting point – determined by the current vitality and status – that it tends towards. Morale can be lost due to Vitality damage, supply loss or over exertion; it can be gained by resting, expending supplies for that purpose, or overcoming major obstacles. 

Supplies: A measure of the amount of supplies the expedition has access to. This number can be thought of as the mana or energy of the expedition. It can both increase and decrease, but will never recover on its own. Supplies are expended to take expedition actions, send out away missions, to gain a single bonus to a non-combat action, to negate or because of random events. 

 

Each expedition has 4 named characters, each has a type which confers certain perks by default. Further other perks and flaws can be assigned to them. For as long as that character is alive, expedition will benefit from their perks. The expedition will always suffer a character's flaws, even after that character dies. Perks are always determined randomly, unless otherwise stated. Every perk taken has a 50% chance in also resulting in a random flaw. 

 

The following is a list of the base characters and perks that can be taken. 

 

Characters: 

Executive Officer – The XO is the logistic head of the expedition, they reduce all supply costs by 1 (to a minimum of 1) and increase all supplies gained by 1. 

Lamplighter – The lamplighters are tasked with protecting the preserving the Lucent Flames that keep the Gloom at bay. A Lamplighter carries with them 1 Lucent Spark which can be used to light a Lucent Fire in a hex that does not have one. A lucent fire hinders the Gloom and its minions in that hex. A lucent spark has no effect if not in a fire. Allows the Expedition to light Lucent Fires. 

Wayfinder – Wayfinders are elite scouts and explorers. When an expedition draws a random event, they can see it before it resolves and have a chance to spend supplies to partially negate it. 

Chief Engineer – Sent by the Guilds of Lustera, these crafts people are the best of the best. Any construction undertaken by an expedition with a chief engineer gains +2 health, and any repairs they attempt fully restore the construction. Note: Can only build and repair Lucent Fires if a Lamplighter is also present. 

Surgeon General – A medical professional well versed in triage and field medicine. Has a 1 in 6 chance to negate up to 2 vitality loss from any one event. 

Expedition Consular – A morale officer specifically trained for the trials of an expedition. Increases all resting morale thresholds by 5. Further they improve all morale gains and losses by 10%. 

Quartermaster – The Expedition begins with 50 additional supplies. 

Platoon Commander – The Expedition begins with 10 extra Vitality. 

The Jack – Begins play with 1 perk of your choice. 

 

Perks: 

Improved Ability: Increases the effect of a character's core ability by 1 or 50% whichever is greater. 

Determined: Reduces the low-morale thresholds by 10.  

Guide: Eases all navigation checks. 

Wrecker – Salvage actions grant 50% increased supplies.

## Expedition Rules 

 

Vitality, Morale, and how Expeditions die. 

 

As stated early, vitality represents an expeditions health and it can only decrease and, when it reaches 0 the expedition ends. Morale is the pluck and determination of the expedition to face hardships. Both are key to understanding the overall health of the expedition. 

 

Morale can be thought of as a sort of shield. When it is high, most vitality loss is prevented (though for an equal amount of morale loss) and when it is low, most vitality loss is increased. In game terms while morale is above 75% all vitality loss is taken to morale instead. When morale falls below 25% all vitality loss is increased by 50%. While between 75 and 25% there is a chance, equal to the current morale score to decrease all vitality loss by 50% (but morale is reduced by the amount prevented). 

 

Morale is also lost in a few other ways; for starters anytime supplies are lost or forced to be spent (usually as a result of a random event) morale is reduced by half the amount of supplies lost. Further, every state the expedition finds itself in has a 'morale threshold' morale slowly moves towards the current threshold either increasing or decreasing each day.

Attrition 

 

Expeditions are dangerous and exact a steep cost from the brave souls who undertake them and no matter how careful expeditioners are accidents happen. Any action can trigger attrition, though only as a result of failure (and usually only a critical failure). Whenever a GM Intrusion is rolled (usually by rolling a 1) the expedition suffers attrition (usually d2, but can be higher). Things such as traps and random events can trigger attrition too. 

 

Another common source of attrition is when a PC is killed. Whenever a PC is killed, they 'respawn' at half resources and only with their last 2 recoveries available; this is at a cost of 4 vitality. 

 

## Supplies 

 

Supplies are the 'mana' of the expedition and are gained and lost quite often. They do not recover on their own, but can be gotten in a number of ways. 

 

Supplies are spent and lost by: 

Taking an expedition action 

Sending out away missions 

Gaining a one-use asset for a non-combat check 

Negating the effects of random events 

Lost as a result of random events 

 

Supplies are gained by: 

Finding them as loot 

Gaining them as a result of an away mission 

Gaining them as the result of an expedition action 

Gained passively by an outpost 

 

Away Missions 

 

An away mission is one that can be undertaken by members of the expedition that resolves 'off screen'. Generally PCs cannot go on away missions, but a regular character whose player is absent for a session can be sent (though they can be lost by attrition for the usual 4 vitality cost) 

 

Every away mission has a level, which determines the chance of success and the supplies cost of the mission, a duration, which lists the number of days the mission takes, a minimum vitality, in order to receive rewards, and a reward for completing the mission. Additional vitality can be sent on the mission, up to triple the minimum, to increase the odds of getting rewards (though all have a chance to be lost as a result of attrition). Further, additional supplies can be spent to reduce the level of the mission (which increases its odds of success) and also to decrease how long the mission takes. Some missions do not give rewards on a failure. 

The cost of a mission is equal to its base level. 

 

Some sample missions are: 

Forage the Salt Cliffs, Level 5, 1 day, 2 vitality, rewards 15 supplies and 5 morale 

Clear out a Brine Howler Nest, Level 6, 2 days, 6 vitality, rewards 5 morale, 2 expedition experience, d3 cyphers 

Stoke the Lucent Fire, Level 3, 1 day, 1 vitality, rewards 7 morale
