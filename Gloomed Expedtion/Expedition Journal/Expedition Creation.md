# Expedition Creation 

Creating an expedition is fairly simple, but can have major effects on how it functions in the old world. Players are encouraged to plan carefully. 

First, the new expedition will be christened with its number and will start with 100 vitality, 100 morale, and 100 supplies. 

Second, players will decide on the 4 named specialists they will take with them.  Then players can choose perks. They get 1 random perk for free and may attach it to whoever they wish. They may gain 2 more random perks in exchange for 1 random flaw. Alternatively, players may gain a perk of their choice, but the GM may assign them a flaw of the GM's choice. Each specialist can have only one perk, unless otherwise stated. 

If at least one is chosen randomly that character receives an additional random perk for free. 

Third, players will review and, if needed, choose their expedition abilities (there will not be many available at the start).
