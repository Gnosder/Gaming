# The story so far  

 

  A hundred years ago the Gloom appeared in the Mining District of Old Lustera. The cataclysm that resulted tore the city asunder and cast a large section of the city to a far off corner of the world. Survivors of the 'Forced Exile' tried to get back to the mainland, but fierce storms prevented them from doing so. 

  5 years ago the storms went abruptly silent and scouts were able to make landfall. What they found was a land ravaged and deeply changed by the Gloom, full of dangers both new and old. A year ago the Expeditionary Forces of Light sent out expedition 0 to establish a foot hold and begin the reclamation of the Old World. Utilizing a pre-gloom technology called La pens√©e (pawn-say) that allows for the one way sending of reports and data from the old world, E0 was able to stay in touch with Lustera; however their casualties mounted quickly. 

  Now a second expedition, called expedition 1, is being sent from Lustera to find and destroy the source of the Gloom. They know their odds of success are slim and so their secondary mission is to learn and lay the trail for the expeditions that follow. The motto of the Expeditionary Forces of Light is "For those who come after" along with "When one falls, we continue." 

  Little is known of the Gloom. It did spread to the waters around Lustera in the past 15 years, but the Sacred Luminous Font sees to repel it. What is known is that the Gloom resembles a thick fog that seems attracted to and smothers light. It hastens entropy and decay; causing rapid erosion and oxidation in non-organics and rapid mutation (often seen as a devolution) in organics. The survivors have taken to calling themselves Les Vivants (Lay Vee-vahn; The Vital or living ones) and the fallen of the world Les Vides (lay veed; the voids or empty ones). Its known that the gloom, while not itself alive, hides some sinister malevolence. 

 

# The Vital City of Lustera 

 

Lustera was a major city in the old world that was torn from its place and cast into the sea when the Gloom first appeared.  It is now the last known bastion of the Lucent. Austere and alive Lustera is the strongly beating heart of those who resist the Gloom. 

 

Within the city are a few major factions. The Lamplighters are the guardians of Lustera, it is under their guidence that the city persists. The Guilds are tradesmen, artisans, and merchants who see to the day to day life within the city. Finally the Expeditionary Forces of the Light are the men and women who strike against the Gloom and push into the old world to dispel it. The PCs will be a part of this faction, but could have come from and will be support by the others. 

 

Major Locations in the city 

 

The Luminous Font :: A mysterious power welling up from beneath the city that repels the Gloom. It flows down 'Lucent Roads' maintained by the Lamplighters.
