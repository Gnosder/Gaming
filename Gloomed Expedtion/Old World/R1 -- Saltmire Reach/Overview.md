# Region 1: Saltmire Reach 

Level 4 (12)  

## History 

Before the Exile the coastal region of the Saltmire Reach was home to the Halfling city of Sea Breeze and the Dwarven Stronghold City of Mag Doral. They existed in peace with Sea Breeze facilitating the trade of Dwarven crafts among the rest of the world. Once the Gloom began to spread the halflings of Sea Breeze united with the Dwarves to hold it at bay. They sealed the mountain pass against it and held the keys in 3 of their sacred strongholds: the Tower at High Hill, the Necropolis of Last Fall, and the Mine of Gugh Boldir. Knowing it was only a matter of time before the Gloom made it over, or under, the mountains that shielded them the defenders did not sit idle. Several Lucent Fires were constructed, one at each of the main strongholds, and 3 at the base of the mountain pass which they hardened  into the fortress of Narrow Pass which they meant to defend against the gloom and its minions. However the Gloom got behind their defenses and began its inevitable destruction of those who would stand against it.  The Dwarves at Mag Doral fell silent first and then one by one each of the strongholds fell to the Gloom, their Lucent Fires were extinguished and destroyed until only Sea Breeze remained. The survivors attempted to flee aboard ship, meaning to sail deep into the heart of the wild ocean around the continent. Their fates are still unknown almost 100 years later. 

## Terrain 

Saltmire Reach are a small coastal region situated between the Wild Ocean and the nearly impassible Sky Lord mountains. The coastal scrub quickly gives way to lush forests that persist up to the very foot of the steep mountains. There is only one known passage through the mountains, known in the area as the Throat of the Mountains, that is now guarded by the fortress of Narrow Pass and sealed by the Great Ward. The Dwarven Stronghold City of Mag Doral sits at the northern most base of the mountains in the region. It is unknown, even to the Dwarves who lived there how deep the mines of Mag Doral went. 

## Region Flow 

Expeditions will start in New Sea Breeze, the base camp created by E0, and will likely explore the observatory at High Hill first where they will learn about the Ward and its keys. They will either need the three keys to dispel the Great Ward or to travel though the abyss beneath Mag Doral; with the first path leading to the cold, volcanic forest of Ice Cinder and the second leading to the low-land estuary of the Verdant Basin.

## Hex 1 – Brinestone Downs 

Level 4; Forage as Level 3 

The coastal scrub cliffs of the Salted Harbor once housed the halfling city of Sea Breeze and served as a major trade post for the region. The trade cogs of Sea Breeze ranged far up and down the coast reaching far away, exotic locales. Now all that is left are rusted hulks of massive steel ships and windblown ruins. The Gloom is less dense in this area, likely as a result of the nearby lucent fire. At night the dinging of long ruined buoys can be heard in the bay. 

 



 

 

### Sea Breeze Ruins 

 

Once a large city housing almost 100 thousand residents, now all that remains are salt worn ruins jutting up into the cold sea breeze. Despite the nearby Lucent Fire, Gloom still pools in the darkened interiors of the ruins and, at night, seeps out of a vast network of sea caves beneath the city. 

 

### New Sea Breeze 

 

All that remains of the happy coastal city of Sea Breeze. Its Lucent Fire was repaired and restoked by Expedition 0 which constructed the harbor. This fire allows the Salted Harbor to be a base camp (as opposed to an outpost or camp site) 

 

Most of Sea Breeze has been consumed by the sea or re-wilded by the surrounding flora.  The pier has mostly collapsed into the sea, but the water was deep enough that the harbor is still useable. Expedition 0 built out a makeshift pier that can handle a few ships at a time. All of E0's ships have been either sunk into tide breaks or pulled ashore to create housing. 

 

### A1 Howling in the Salt Spray  

 

See attached page. 

 

## Hex 2 – Starbrow 

 

A lightly forested coastal plain a ways off of the Brinestone Downs. A single tall hill is the sole landmark of the area, the ruined observatory of High Hill sits atop it. Once the scientific capital of the region it was observatory, university, and library all. If any records still exist about what befell the region, they would be there. 

 

### Away Missions 

 

The Gloom interferes with star gazing, a lucent fire is needed to unlock the Chart the Stars Mission 

Chart the Stars; L4, 5 Supplies, 1 Day, 1 Vitality, +1 free reroll 

Explore the Past; L4, 10 supplies, 1 Day, 2 Vitality, +2 Experience (Can be distributed as desired) 

 

### High Hill 

 

A tall hill – not quite a mountain as it does not remotely compare to the nearby mountain range – on which the Halflings of Sea Breeze constructed the High Hill Observatory and University. The Observatory is a vast structure that snakes on, around, and through the hill. 

 

### A2 – In the Hollowed Halls of Knowledge 

 

See attached Page 

 

## Hex 3 – Fall Shade 

 

A dense, primeval forest shielded from the biting coastal winds by jagged cliffs. It was here, in this ancient place that the Necropolis of Last Fall was constructed. 

 

### Last Fall 

 

A solemn and consecrated place where the fallen of Sea Breeze were laid to rest. Constantly maintained rituals prevent the dead from rising and ensure the fallen rest. 

 

### A3 – Dirge for the Living 

 

## Hex 4 – Shatter Spine Ridge 

 

An area of jagged sea cliffs. Dwarven prospectors found silver beneath the water line and constructed the mine of Gugh Boldir there. 

 

### Gugh Boldir 

 

A dwarven silver mine that was in use up until the Gloom consumed it. 

 

### A4 – In the tarnished heart of silver 

 

## Hex 5 – The Anvilfast 

 

A rocky and treacherous expanse at the foot of the great mountain known as 'Foe Hammer' (or Tàranchuir (TAH-run-khoor) in the original dwarven). Houses the great dwarven stronghold city of Mag Doral. 

 

### Mag Doral 

 

A5+ -- In the Shadows of Greed 

 

## Hex 6 – Throat of the Mountains 

 

A wide pass carved through the mountains that connects the Saltmire Reach to areas beyond. A massive gate blocks passage through the pass. This gate was constructed by the allied races of Saltmire Reach to serve as the defensive choke point into the region.
