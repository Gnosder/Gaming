Level 3

This short adventure will serve as the introduction to the system and world, though the Gloom will be hinted at and not fully present.

### Summary

An empty scout dingy washes back to the docks, blood spray and cracked boards indicate a struggle. Brine Howlers are the most likely culprate, but none have been spotted so close to the Lucent Fire. Watchers at Lookout point have not seen any, but they have noticed Gloom clinging more tightly to a rusted ship wreck in a place they call the "terminal Strand". If Howlers have been moving into the area, they need to be culled or the harbor will become unsafe for arriving expeditions.

In truth a nest of 7 Brine Howlers is in a nearby wreck. During low tide there is a rocky land path that leads to the ship. The path is guarded by Brine Howlers, Gloom Wisps, and covered with Gloomed Kelp.

The Brine Howlers will try and lure anyone who comes close into an ambush in an attempt to protect their nest. The session should run very much like a horror game. Play up deceptive tactics of both the Brine Howlers and the Gloom Wisps. It will happen at night, probably, as that is the most likely time of the low tide needed to walk to the nest (they could take a boat...)

Remember that this won't kill the characters but it will sap their resources and set the tone for how the expedition will go.

Each encounter should be suspenseful, having them turn into combat should be treated as a fail state. The Brine Howlers would prefer to target characters outside of the nest.

Mission: Clear out the close Brine Howler nest to protect the bay.

The story so far: A hundred years ago a the Gloom appeared in the Mining District of Old Lustera. The cataclysm that resulted tore the city asunder and cast a large section of the city to a far off corner of the world. Survivors of the 'Forced Exile' tried to get back to the mainland, but fierce storms prevented them from doing so.
  5 years ago the storms went abruptly silent and scouts were able to make landfall. What they found was a land ravaged and deeply changed by the Gloom, full of dangers both new and old. A year ago the Expeditionary Forces of Light sent out expedition 0 to establish a foot hold and begin the reclamation of the Old World. Utilizing a per-gloom technology called La pensée (pawn-say) that allows for the one way sending of report and data from the old world, E0 was able to stay in touch with Lustera; however their casualties mounted quickly.
  Little is known of the Gloom. It did spread to the waters around Lustera in the past 15 years, but the Sacred Luminous Font sees to repel it. What is known is that the Gloom resembles a thick fog that seems attracted to and smothers light. It hastens entropy and decay; causing rapid erosion and oxidation in non-organics and rapid mutation (often seen as a devolution) in organics. The survivors have taken to calling themselves Les Vivants (Lay Vee-vahn; The Vital or living ones) and the fallen of the world Les Vides (lay veed; the voids or empty ones). Its known that the gloom, while not itself alive, hides some sinister malevolence.

Explore New Sea Breeze
  The port of the fallen city of Sea Breeze has been reclaimed by E0. They have constructed a permanent camp a few hundred feet past the old Sea Wall that holds the tides at bay. Various Locations in camp:

The Lucent Fire

A large bonfire kept burning in the center of the camp that holds the Gloom at bay. Céleste keeps a small tent near the fire to keep an eye on it.

Lookout Point

On a high sea cliff overlooking the city of Sea Breeze, just within reach of the Lucent Fire, a squat tower has been constructed that is used both as the Camp's lighthouse and Edrin Voss' office.

The Wayfinder

The flagship of E0 that they pulled ashore and turned into their living quarters and HQ. Watch Commander Matthias Prudhomme can be found on the deck, collecting and reading reports.

After Exploring the camp...

A shout comes up from the beech. A small, 2 man dingy, sun bleached and worn, washes ashore. It is quickly identified as having been used by 2 E0 scouts, Claude and Invanna. The boat shows signs of a brutal attack; it's missing its ores, blood spray coats one of rowing benches, claw marks cut deeply into the wood on the exterior. (It was attacked by Brine Howlers who clawed up the sides and dragged the two scouts underwater.) That the boat was able to be drawn into port by the current (or clever machinations of the Brine Howlers) implies that they are far more active in the immediate area than they should be. A cull is needed. It is unlikely that either of the scouts is still alive, but returning their remains could be good for morale.

Based on an understanding of the area the Brine Howlers must have come from somewhere near the Terminal Strand; a sandbar that only appear during low tide which houses a few post-gloom wrecks.

Voss should make sure the characters are fully aware of the threat of Brine Howlers and Gloom Wisps.

The Terminal Strand

The strand only appears at low tide and that only happens after dusk (in this season). While traveling under the Hanging Cliffs they hear ghostly bells tolling out in the water (Brine Howlers mimicking the sounds of Sea Breeze's now ruined buoys) and are buffeted by icy winds blowing in off the sea.

At the entrance to the strand the ghostly light of a Gloom Wisp can be seen floating in the night.

As they near the Wisp it fades away only to reappear a short distance down the strand, it will repeat this behavior; seeming to beckon the characters down the strand. After the wisp vanishes the first time, a weak, pleading cry can be heard out in the waves. "Please … help … cold ..." it is weakly heard between the lapping waves (it's a brine howler) and a dark shape can been seen bobbing just outside the light (assuming the characters have a light source). Should they enter the water, the Howler will try to grab one and down them under the surf, it will flee if unable to do so.

As the characters move further down the strand more Gloom Wisps can been seen floating above the water, they vanish if anyone gets near. Wisp light reveals a small rocky outcrop not far off the strand; the dark shape of a Brine Howler can been seen on it, it appears to be sleeping. (This Howler is lying in ambush, the direct path to its location is covered in Saw Weed; Gloom Flora that deals speed damage to those who try to move through it; and 2 other Howlers are lying in wait under the water near the first. They will try to separate the characters and pick them off one at a time, dealing jagged, mortal wounds to their targets; they will not fight to the death).

As the characters near the wreck of the Joyous Waverider lightning flashes in the distance as a storm rolls near the bay. It highlights the jagged, toothlike hulk of the wrecked steel ship. Entering the ship through a ragged hole at sea level  introduces characters to their first look at  Gloom. A deep darkness seems to slither through the wreck, that seems to weaken their light sources. A deep croaking sound can be heard that seems to be coming from all directions at once "… cold… death …". A crude, grisly totem hangs against a rusting bulkhead, it seems to be held up by some kind of dark, slimy membrane; it appears to be a collection of fish and human bones, and seems to hold some ancient, unsettling power.

Cold, brackish sea water sits thigh deep in the dark hulk. 3 Howlers lie in wait, they will assault the characters once they are halfway across the room. They can sense unprotected flesh and will target those who are most lightly armored. They will prefer hit and run tactics; attacking and then slipping back beneath the dark water to reposition for the next attack. One should always be In motion and those that are above the water will be used a decoys for the others to slip behind their targets. These Howlers will fight until slain (they are protecting their nest).
    Intrusion A Gloom Wisp flashes into existence granting an asset to all howlers for 1 round. A second intrusion while the wisp is active will charm the nearest PC.

As the last Howler dies, its thick blood pooling into the dark water a Gloom Wisp appears further into the ship. This one does not vanish as the characters get close, instead another lights up just ahead of the first.
The characters can feel the wreckage opening up as they enter to what was a cargo hold, its rough torn off revealing a tumultuous night sky above them. Gloom Wisps light up the area, bathing the hold in cold light that reveals a large bone pile in the center, held together with the same dark membrane as the totem. A brine howler stands defiantly atop the bone pile, it hisses menacingly and in a deep, rasping voice says "… kill … you …" 3 more brine howlers lie in ambush under the water, using the first as bait. They will fight to the death.

  The wisps will actively assist the Howler and hinder the characters, but no more than twice per round. (use more to increase the difficulty of the fight)
Intrusion A character steps on a weakened section of the deck which gives way, they fall into  the bay a Brine Holwer in hot pursuit.

After the last Brine Howler is slain the wisps vanish, leaving the hold in darkness. Examining the bone pile reveals it to be the creature's nest. In its center lie human remains (the 2 missing scouts) and, growing from their bodies, a thin jagged ivy with a single black blossom which is pitch black and seems to consume light (this is a Gloom Blossom). Disturbing the blossom cause the Gloom to vibrate violently, it is then drawn into the blossom which bursts into a Gloom Reaper, a tall shadowlike being who right arm is a wicked scythe blade, which destroys the nest and knocks the characters backwards. The Reaper seems to take their measure and then flies up, vanishing into the night.

The hold contains d6 old world cyphers and d6 supplies (packed in crates preserved by the sea water).
