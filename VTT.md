# Running Sessions online and VTTs

I'm not a fan, but they are becoming a fact of life. There has to be a way I can run my games without hating myself.

The big thing, I think, is that I need to not care about character sheets. I do not want to be 'Master of the VTT', tech support is not my job. Right?

## Theater of the Mind and VTTs

Virtual Table Tops are flexible and many have an abundance of features. The most important thing about using them is remembering: You don't have to use everything.

Theater of the mind is a style of play where all the action happens in the mind of the players. It doesn't feature maps or minitures. It requires strong naration and buy in from the players.

To run a TotM game it's vital to set the scene properly, giving all the info and flavor it needs. Then reinforce the scene.
