# The Frozen Wastes of Hoarfrost

An area of sparsly forested, high altitude plateaus that are constantly buffeted by icy winds and now. The colossus of the same name rests at the center of the region and is more of an oblisk than colossus. The frozen tempratures and icy winds originate from the colossus. The region is populated by fierce tribes of giants, they prefer to vie against each other in an eternal struggle for surpreamacy, but they do not tolerate outsiders and will unify to remove them. The giants are mostly nomadic and follow/cultivate large herds of mammoths.
