# Wildcard

## Introduction

Wildcard is a system replacement and suppliment for ttrpgs. The purpose of Wildcard is to expand the mechanical abilities of ttrpgs without adding too much 'bloat'. Most of the Wildcard rules are GM facing.

## Overview

### The Fate Deck

WIldcard replaces the dice rolling of traditional ttrpgs with a deck of cards called the Fate Deck. Whenever a player would roll a die they instead draw a card from the Fate Deck. The Fate Deck cards are valued from 1-20 (for d20 base systems) the deck also cointains a joker, 1 for every full set of cards (i.e. for every 20 there is 1 joker). Cards also have a suit: Doom, Destiny, Law, Chaos. The fate deck is shuffled at the start of each session and each scene as well as when it runs out. All participants in a scene draw from the same deck.

When a joker is played it counts as the highest card in the deck and may be kept and used once as a wildcard.

The cards also have a second value, usually  from 1-10 with 5-6 being most common. This is typically used for damage. In a d20 ttrpg you could read 3d6 damage as draw 3 cards and add the damage.
    >Note: Yes this makes all weapons and attacks do d10 (ish, as it skews a bit closer to d8, or, rather, d9), but that is rarely a problem and if it is the results can be modified thusly: -2 for d4, -1 for d6, +1 for d12.

### The Wild Deck

There is a second deck of cards that are given out to characters as boons/rewards/inspiration/etc. These cards tend to have values of 15+ and can impart special effects. A player may replace any 1 drawn card with a Wild card, this discards the wild card. The Wild Deck is suffled at the start of each session or when it runs out of cards. By default, a player may have no more than 2 wild cards at any given time.

## Checks

Making ability checks, saving throws, et. all, works mostly the same as before. Flip a card, add bonuses and penalties to it and then compare the result to a DC/TN.
    If, for example, you have advantage you would draw 2 cards and choose the highest.
If you have a wild card you may replace your card with it. You may use only 1 wild card per check, regardless of how many cards you draw.
After the check all cards used are discarded in their appropriate place (fate cards in the fate discard, wild cards in the wild discard).

## Standoff

A standoff is a conflict between 2 or more parties that has not yet come to blows (physical or otherwise). Standoff's escalate and set the consequences for the conflict. The rules for a standoff are pretty straight forward. A standoff is played out as a simplified version of poker. Cards are dealt to each participant

Each party is dealt 2 cards to form their hand. They can look at their hand and should keep it secret from their opponents. Skills don't factor into a standoff, it's a game of chicken.
Starting with the party that began the conflict by saying 'no' or 'putting up a wall' they decide whether to call, raise, or fold.

    Call: Passes play to the next party who may then call, raise, or fold. If all parties call in the same round, the conflict resolves.
    Raise: A new card is dealt to the party. This escalates the conflict, raising the consequences.
    Fold: A party chooses to bow out of the conflict and ceed defeat. Following one party folding, the others must also fold (thus agreeing to end the conflict), if they do not all folds are counted as call for the round. When a party folds they suffer no consequences, but must give over the stakes of the conflict.

Once all parties have called the conflict resolves. To resolve a conflict each participant adds their cards together and reveals the result. The party with the highest result is the winner and the party with the lowest is the loser. 
A party may use up to 2 wild cards to replace cards in their result.

### Escalation and Consequences

As the number of cards held in a standoff increases so too do the potential consequences the loser suffers. The escalation levels and consequences are thus (the level is equal to the lowest number of cards held by a party):

    Level 2: Simple consequences; might result in a minor complication
    Level 3: 'Standard' consequences; usually results in a minor complication and, if combat follows, allows the winner to act first.
    Level 4: High consequences; always results in a complication (minor or major) and the winner automatically deals lethal damage to the loser. In addition the winner acts first in the ensuing combat.
    Level 5: Lethal consequences; Crimes of passion or intent, the loser dies. (Note that this may leave the overall conflict unresolved)

#### Complications

Complications exist in addition to the binary nature of HP (dead or not dead) and represent injuries that impart penalties. Complications may be physical, emotional, or social and are broken up into 4 catagories.

    Minor: small annoyances that recover quickly (brusies to body or ego, for example). They tend to impart minor penalties to specific checks (e.g. -1 when using this pot to cook)
    Major: Lasting and painful consquences, they tend to last from 1 to several sessions and impart minor universal penalties or major specific penalties. (e.g. -2 to social checks in town or -8 to diplomacy with the Diamond Brotherhood)
    Severe: Debilitating injuries and consequences that typically remove characters from play for extended periods of time. These consequences usually take months to heal and months more of work or rehab to fully recover if they ever do.
    Scar: Scars are severe consquences that have healed and,contrary to the nature of other complications, can grant bonuses as well as penalties. Scars can represent lingering injury or disability as well as learned lessons and wisdom. (Scars that don't have a bonus will typically grant XP)

##### Complications and Healing

Complications tend to recover at a rate of 1-4 hours for minor, 1 - 4 weeks for major, 1-4 years for severe, but can be healed faster with appropriate care.

For phsyical consequences:
With medical treatment a complication can heal 25% faster, with bedrest and constant treatment they can heal 50% faster. Magical healing can rapiddly remove consequences. When receiving magical healing, a consequence may be reduced by 1 level of severity if the target is already at full HP. A consequence can only be lowered by one level in this way, unless a spell specifies otherwise.
    >TODO: or something someting 25% max hp (scale?)
An exception to this is minor consequences which disappear after receiving any magical healing.

##  Boons/Adjustments/Mechanics

This section is written as a non-inclusive list of potential mechanics and options that can be added to work with this system.

### Deck Manipluation

Abilities and spells can do things to view or rearange the deck. Examples:
    Look a x cards and:
        Put them back in the same order, any order, or random order
        Put all or some of them in the discard or bottom of the deck
        Play one for your check or keep 1 for a future check
        Replace your or an opponents result with one of the card

### Deck 'Poisoning'

Poison cards can take several forms. They could be low cards, they could force a critical failure, they can grant complications to the one who draws them, etc. examples include:
    Place a 'critical failure card' on top, x from the top, randomly into the deck

### Suits

Intrisicallly, suits are just asthetic, but they can be expanded on quite easily. The suits and their meansing are thus:
    Destiny: A representation of hope and fortitude. A positive result for players
    Doom: A manisfestation of dread or despair. A negative result for players
    Law: A manifestation of order, law, or civility. A positive result for 'Law' aligned characters
    Chaos: A manifestation of chaos, barbarism, or disharmony. A positive result for 'Chaos' aligned characters
    *note that the converse is usually also true; i.e. a postive result for players can also be negative for GMs
Abilities can be keyed to operate off of suits, such as "Deals an extra card of damage if a Destiny is drawn" or "After drawing a Chaos card, you may discard the top 3 cards of the deck and use one of them instead." or "after drawing a Destiny card take +2 forward for the scene."

## Scenarios

A few example scenarios

### Scenario 1

Edric enters Ruin of Gods gambling den. He wants to meet his contact, a fence named Stell, and offload some stolen goods. He sees Stell seated at a booth and walks over to him.

"This seat taken?" Edric says as he sits down.
"Why ask if you're just going to take it anyways?" Stell eyes the small satchel Edric carries under his arm. "I hope that's not for me. Your coin isn't spending as well as it used to."
"That's news to me. Things went fine on my end, why don't you tell me what happened on yours?"
"I'm shiny, squeaky clean. Perhaps you're slipping if you think you're spotless. Regardless, I've got no business with you."
"You going to tell me what you know, or are you just going to let me twist?"
"No. I don't think I will. I'm sure you have other contacts you can harass."

...

Stell is holding out on important info he doesn't want to share, Edric wants to know what happened to his reputation. Because Stell 'put up the wall' by saying no, he is the aggressor. Both players are dealt 2 cards, this is the start of their conflict. If Edric wins he gets what he wants, otherwise he does not. The aggressor goes first, Stell calls. He doesn't think Edric will take this to blows in the gambling den. Edric raises and is delt a new card, he's betting on Stell folding. Stell, surprised by Edric's willingness to escalate, folds and Edric follows suit. Stell tells Edric what has happened, that his old partner is working with the police and that Edric is 'hot'. Stell will remember this and gains a wild card.

> The one who begins the conflict is the person who says 'no'.
> Players can see their own face down cards. Players may add a single wildcard to their hand in place of another card.
> If a player folds their opponents may accept or decline. If a fold is declined it counts as a call.

In this example, if Stell had raised...
Stell raises and is dealt a third card. Edric underestimated Stell's resolve, but feels he is now comittied, so he calls. Stell calls as well. The hands are revealed, showing Stell with a 15 and Edric with a 17. Edric wins and since he was the first to call, narrates his action and then his victory.
'Edric grasps Stell's head and slams it into the table with a loud crash.' Stell takes damage and suffers a bloody nose. He tells Edric what he heard and leaves to tend his nose.

In this example, if Stell had raised and Edric was dealt bad cards...
Stell raises and is dealt a third card. Edric underestimated Stell's resolve, he looks at the cards he was dealt and sees 2 ones. Even with a good card, he doubts he can win. Edric folds and Stell does likewise. Stell wins and decides the outcome, but Edric gains a Wild Card.
"This isn't the place, Edric. Now, run along and bother someone else."

In this example, if Edric had bad cards but had a wild card...
Edric looks at his cards and sees 2 ones, but he knows he has a twenty card that he can play in place of one of them. He decides to call. Stell folds, he doesn't want to damage his working relationship with the den by spilling any blood. Edric folds as well, Stell tells him what he wanted to know. Though Stell is none too pleased by the outcome and gains a wild card.

### Scenario 3 - Orc attack

A party of adventur food (fighter, cleric, theif, wizard) comes face to face with a group of savage orcs. The orcs are clearly aggressive and homicidle. The party, likewise, desires the sweet xp of the orcs. Thus someone is likely to die. However, that doesn't automatically mean the standoff will go to level 5 or that there will even be a standoff. Let's play it out.

Both parties square up, they both expect and want violence. A standoff here doesn't make much sense, instead the game goes to combat rounds and initiative is rolled. This is because both parties want the same thing (violence), there is no conflict (save the one that is incipient, but that is more a contest) for a standoff.

#### What if the party doesn't want to fight the orcs?

The GM of the game is smart and hasn't tied gaining XP to something dumb like killing orcs. The party has no reason to want to fight the orcs. In fact they would prefer not to, so that they can save resources for the dungeon delve that they know is coming up. The party leader asks the orcs to stand aside and let the pass. The orc leader says 'no' and with an evil grin brandishes his brutal great axe.

Both parties are delt 2 cards. In this case the orcs put up the wall by saying 'no' and so go first. They want blood to be spilled so they raise and are delt a third card. The adventuers are fine going to 3, so they call and so get delt a third card. The orcs are frothing at the mouth now and raise again, they are delt their forth card. The adventurers are pretty sure they can win in a fight, but don't want to risk the major consequence 4 cards represents, so they fold. The orcs, wanting blood, don't accept and so both groups call. The orcs reveal their 4 cards with a total of 46, the adventuers reveal their 3 cards with a total of 44. The orcs win and so deal damage to the party and impose a minor consequence, they also act first in the ensuing combat*. The adventurers get to decide who takes the damage.

The orcs bellow and charge, the fighter steps between the theif (their 'leader') and the head orc. He takes 5 damage from the orc's vicious blow and suffers damage to his armor (this damage will persist until repaired via magic or a short rest). Combat now begins.

* Maybe instead of going first, it should give a bonus to init.

### AMBUSH

A group of sneaky goblins has been stalking the adventuers. While the latter has been resting following a battle with orcs, the formor is getting ready to ambush them. This will never result in a standoff as the nature of an ambush lies counter to the idea of a standoff. Thus the encounter will be run using the standard ambush rules.

## Does a standoff have to result in combat?

No, if neither party wants it, combat will not ensue. If, however, one party wants to fight they will attempt to do so.

Standoffs work best for non-combat conflicts, but can be used to determine the initial position of a combat.
