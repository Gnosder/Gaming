# Gotta Punch Trees

Every game needs to start the same way: punching trees. Or, rather, pruning some rampaging dryads and weed spirits.

We start in the small hamlet of Miriwoa where a group volunteers have agreed to help reclaim the town's Orchard from some wild spirits.

Summary: The characters arrive in town and meet the Sherif who is welcoming but cautious. As the characters move through town they meet Tama outside the Orchad as he watches the sprites dance. They mee the Mayor outside the lodge (Inn) who tells them of the town and how Kalina is troubled by the sprites (though he doesn't see why, they come by every now and again and do little harm). Kalina askes the characters to look into the sprites and protect the mother tree. Tama wants to tag along. The orchard is being attacked by a thorn dryad and its minions.

# Miriwoa

Ordinary day, the ochard is being bothered by dryad's but no one is really bothered (it'll be dealt with in time). Meet the Mayor, Sherif, Wood Speaker, and Berry Picker.

# The Orchard

Goal: Defend the orchard from the Sprites and investigate the Mother Tree. Protect it at all costs.
Appearance: A lush orchard with trees bursting with fruit. The gently cool air smells sweet and earthy. A few dancing sprites can be seen dancing amongst the trees, but they look out of place, their appearance sharp and thorny.

## Encouters

# Encounter 1: Orchard Brawl

Setting: The party enters a lush orchard, but the trees are beginning to twist and grow wild. Thorny vines cover the ground, and the air hums with the sound of buzzing insects. The Wild Thorn Sprites, playful but chaotic, are causing havoc.

Enemies:
Wild Thorn Sprites (5)
Bramble Dryad (leader of the Thorn Sprites as a shadowy figure in the distance, directing them. Watches, but casts entangle on casters as the fight wears on.)

# Encounter 2: Corrupting the Mother Tree (Mini-Boss Fight)

Setting: The Mother Tree stands at the center of the orchard, large, ancient, and full of life. However, it’s being corrupted by the Bramble Dryad, who is channeling dark magic. The adventurers must defend the tree from the Dryad’s magic and fight off any remaining Thorn Sprites. Once the dryad is defeated the sprites vanish and the dryad retreats to their position outside the orchard. They begin channeling magic that can be felt by the characters.

Enemies:
    Bramble Dryad
    Wild Thorn Sprite (3)
    Corrupted Vines (environmental hazard)

# Encounter 3: Boss Fight with the Bramble Dryad Outside the Orchard

Setting: The party faces the Dryad once again, but this time outside the orchard, in a clearing surrounded by thick thorns and creeping vines. The dryad, now desperate, is calling upon more sprites and twisting the earth beneath the party’s feet. Once defeated the dryad drops a bone fetish (DC15 the bone is from a humanoid).

Enemies:
    Bramble Dryad (Main Boss)
    Wild Thorn Sprites (4)
    Corrupted Vines (Active Hazard)

Changes for this encounter:
The Bramble Dryad has a new, more dangerous environment to manipulate, such as creating traps or controlling the terrain to hinder the players’ movement. She should focus on summoning more Thorn Sprites and using spells that affect the environment. She could also be more aggressive, using her summoning abilities and casting spells to disorient the players.

## Wind Down

The Fetish suggests that this was not, in fact, natural. The mayor sends the characters to meet a Seer/Witch-doctor nearby in order to divine its purpose and origin. This leads to A2.

The **Corrupted Vines** in the second encounter could be a significant environmental hazard, adding a dangerous layer of strategy for the players. Here's a detailed description of how they could function and visually appear:

### Corrupted Vines (Environmental Hazard)

**Appearance:**  
The vines appear as twisted, thick tendrils of thorny growth, which seem to pulsate with a faint, eerie green glow. The vines are covered in barbed thorns that glisten with dark, viscous sap. They snake across the ground in a labyrinth-like pattern and climb up nearby trees, looking like they are alive—constantly twitching and shifting, as if reaching out to grab anything that passes too close. In the vicinity of the Mother Tree, the vines seem especially dense and unnaturally vibrant, as if the corruption has made them grow uncontrollably.

**Hazard Mechanism:**
The vines act as a trap and hazard, potentially causing both environmental and combat challenges.

1. **Difficult Terrain:**  
   The area is filled with dense, corrupted vines that make movement through the area slow. It costs **double movement** to traverse spaces that are overrun by the vines. Players trying to move through the area must make **Strength (Athletics) checks** to break through the vines.
   - DC 12: Move at half speed.  
   - DC 16: Move at normal speed, but take **1d6 piercing damage** from thorns as they tear through the vines.  
   On a failed check, the player cannot move through the area, and they are **restrained** until they use an action to break free with a Strength (Athletics) check (DC 15).

2. **Entangling Vines (Triggered Hazard):**  
   Any player who enters a square filled with corrupted vines may trigger an **Entangle** effect (save or be restrained).  
   - **Trigger:** Any creature that enters or starts its turn in the corrupted vines must make a **DC 13 Strength saving throw** or become **restrained** as the vines wrap around their legs.  
   - **Escape:** A creature can use its action to make a **Strength (Athletics)** check against DC 13 to break free of the vines. Alternatively, a **Spell** such as *Misty Step* or *Teleport* could bypass the vines.

3. **Vine Lash (Active Hazard):**  (Encounter 3 only)
   Occasionally, a vine may snap out at a player within 10 feet, attacking with great force.
   - **Attack:** Melee Weapon Attack (+5 to hit)  
   - **Hit:** 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.  
   - The vine then retracts quickly into the mass of other vines, potentially entangling the player in the process.

4. **Corruption Aura (Passive Hazard):**  (Encounter 3 only)
   Creatures standing in or near the corrupted vines may feel the effect of the corruption.
   - **Effect:** The air around the vines is thick with a corrupting energy. Creatures within 5 feet of the vines must make a **DC 13 Constitution saving throw** at the start of their turn or take **1d6 poison damage**. On a successful save, they take no damage.

### Interaction with Players:
- Players might try to use spells like *Fireball* or *Flame Strike* to clear the vines, but they would need to be careful because these vines are **resistant to fire damage** due to their corrupted nature.
- Spells like *Thunderwave* could cause the vines to temporarily retract, but they would quickly grow back, re-establishing the hazard.
- Players may need to use their **Strength or Dexterity** (Acrobatics) to maneuver through the hazard quickly or use their actions to hack away at the vines with weapons to clear a path, risking the **Vine Lash** or taking damage from thorns.

The presence of these **Corrupted Vines** adds a tactical challenge for the players, requiring them to think creatively about how they approach combat and movement in this area. The vines also reinforce the theme of the Mother Tree’s corruption, making the environment itself a threat to the party.
