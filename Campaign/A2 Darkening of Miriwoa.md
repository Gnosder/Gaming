# Darkening of Miriwoa

Summary: After finding the fetish Kalina knows this was not natural. She appeals to the mayor with help from the party. The mayor sends them to a witch that lives near town, but she has been taken. The heroes track down and rescue the witch and learn about the necromancer.

DP:
- Kalina Tobu
- Tama
- Mayor Nawei Omataga (Na-way O-ma-ta-ga)
- Madame Visha
> Appearance
> A hunched, elderly lizardfolk woman with mottled green and brown scales, covered in patches of moss and tiny mushrooms that seem to grow naturally on her skin. Her yellow eyes glow faintly with druidic wisdom, and her elongated snout is adorned with small bone charms and beads woven into her facial frills.

> She wears a tattered swamp-colored shawl made from woven reeds and animal pelts, decorated with hanging trinketsâ€”tiny dried frogs, hollowed-out stones, and wooden charms carved with protective runes. Her staff is a twisted branch wrapped in vines, with a glowing amber gemstone embedded at the top, pulsating like a heartbeat.

> When she moves, the damp scent of earth and decay lingers in the air, as if she carries the essence of the swamp with her.

## Scene 1 - Miriwoa

Kalina takes the fetish to the mayor. Nawei does not want to believe that anything out of the normal is happening (he fears the pact with nature will be broken). He needs more proof.

Convince the Mayor DC 30 (-5 per extra piece of proof)
> He can be blackmailed via his affiar with a married man (-10), he can be appealed to via gifts or flattery (-5)

- He asks for guidence from nature (DC 15 nature to find token)
- He asks for consent of the elders (dc 10, 15, 20; need 2 of 3)
- He asks for a first hand account from the heroes

Once permission is given, they will be told about Visha, a nearby witch that could identify the fetish and help find what happened. Tama tags along.

## Scene 2 - Interlude, on the road with Tama

This is the first time Tama has been given a quest by the mayor, he is full of self importance and does not want to mess it up.

## Scene 3 - Visha's Hut

Her hut has been ransaked. Signs of a struggle are evident and fresh blood coats one of the walls of her hut (she killed one of her attackers). 

- survival 15 to find tracks heading into the nearby lowland marsh
- arcana 15 to find that her magical scrying circle has been befouled 
- A hidden, scribbled note says "they're coming. I won't go quite, but I will go. They will take me into the marsh, by the old boat house."
- perception or investigation 20/15 to find a second scribbled note that says "Waters of life. Ash of Renewal. Shun Death."
- On a nearby table, a number of necromantic runes are laid out as if they were being investigated. As well as 3 healing potions and a note "You may want these."

## Scene 4 - Into the marsh

Rapid rot-infested crocodiles bound to runes carved in nearby trees. They will revive until the runes are removed.

## Scene 5 - The Withered Totems

A stone bridge over dangerous waters is warded. 3 totems. Each has a symbol on it LIFE, DEATH, RENEWAL. On the ground near them is a tinderbox (recently used), and a watering can.

If the LIFE totem is watered, the RENEWAL totem is burned or given ash, and the death totem is left as is, the ward disipates and the bridge can be traveled. Otherwise the bridge collapses and the water must be swum accross DC 15 or 1d6 damage and reroll.

## Scene 6 - The Boat House

The boat house is rotting and has not been used for some time. Light can be seen coming from the inside (Anything less than stealth 10 alerts the inside).

Visha is being held in magical circle, and a Rot-Mystic is attempted to corrupt her with dark power. 3 other corrupted Furbolgs are nearby, each wears a pendant that anchors the circle (Kill at least 2 to open the circle), the mystic can't be touched until the circal falls.

## Scene 7 - Voices in the Dark

As the mystic dies he cries out in an unknown language that burns your ears. A deep shadow fills the room, making all light source seem meek (all in shadow). A voice booms out (the necromancer) who taunts the heroes.

Visha can attempt to dispel, but she needs cover (keep him talking) or, if he is attacked, his shadow comes to life and begins to summon undead minions.
