How do I want magic to function?
Magic is the ability to shape the raw essence of reality. It is, at its core, reality bending. Every magical action requires: a power source, a medium (for that power to flow through and to unite it with an image), and an image/formula.

The source and Images are both 'perfect', but the mediums are always flawed. Either they cannot channel the full power or they cannot concieve of the full image or both.

Mortals will have a list of abilities (spell list) which they can cast. 

Speeds of spell casting: Reaction, Action, Full Action, Move Action, bonus action.

Most spells can be cast as an action. This is typically true for rotes and spontaneous casters.

Casting a spell from a tome or casting powerful magic may take a full action: move action to begin casting and standard action to finish
