# Dusk Bastards 4.0

I'm starting the 4th pass on Dusk Bastards system.

What do I like?
- 2d12 Dawn and Dusk
        Add together to determine total value. Largest die triggers either Dawn or Dusk while doubles trigger an eclipse.
        For advantage roll a third die and replace for the total only.
- Most of Cypher System
    - No Cyphers, replace with more 'traditional' system
    - Rework skill system. Maybe a skill group (minor skill) type system. e.g. Athletics (Swimming).
        This would make it similar to 5e, but instead of attributes it uses skills.
        List skills similar to 3.5 or pathfinder
    - Use the item quality and carry rules.
    - Magic needs to be a bit more flexible.


## Ideas:

- Adrenaline in games. When you take a wound, you get a bonus for the rest of combat. At the end of combat you lose the bonus and suffer the wound. Not for critical wounds though, as though will disable part of the body.

- Remove cypher 'death spiral' take damage to avoid damage.  Add health pool or wound track (to work with adrenaline).

- BitD does has a stress and harm track (similar to Fate). Try: When stress hits 0 you are stunned and must use an action to recover if you can. Or you may spend points from your pools 1:1 to regain stress.

- Malice: The GM gets a number of Malice points at the start of each round of combat. They can spend malice to activate enemies (so they may take their turn), enhance enemy actions, or power abilities. This will keep fights tense, even as enemies fall. Inverse ninja. Fights should also have an end condition other than (kill them all) honestly, morale does this fairly well.
