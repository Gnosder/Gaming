=============================

### Building Points

At each level, including the first the outpost generates enough prosperity to upgrade one building. Note that a building cannot reach its 4th and final tier until outpost level 9. A list of buildings and their upgrades is below.

### Perks

Starting at 3rd level and every other level there after the outpost provides a perk to all explorers that have a base there. A list of perks is below.

### Crafting

The legendary smith Andre has brought his equally legendary titan fist forge to Hope's Gambit. He can make items in a fraction of the normal time and is well suited to using the materials of this strange land. He can craft any item of any level so long as he has been supplied with the proper materials. Monster materials and their rules can be seen below.

### Maps

One of the first building set up in Hope's Gambit was a cartographer which also serves as a defacto command tent. Any returning expeditions can give over any maps/charts/etc and they will be added to the master map.

### Scouting Reports

The consortium sometimes sends out scouting parties that can, if they return, give a basic idea as to what to expect.

### Black Market

Shady dealers have found their way into Hope's Gambit, they'll buy items at a premium. Any gold gained from the black market won't help the town upgrade, but can be spent on importing materials for crafting.

### Mage Circle

A circle of arcane spellcasters has begun mapping the leylines of the outlands. Starting at 3rd level they provide explorers up to 3 sigils that, when placed in a location of sufficient power, can allow limited teleportation between the sigil and town.

> Teleportation can effect up to 9 creatures or items of medium size or smaller. Each discreat item counts as 1 creature. (Crates can be useful here).

At 5th level they can craft powerful runes of returning. Once used, a character cannot benefit from the rune again for 1 week. These runes are given to every explorer that can benefit from them when they leave town.

> It takes 1 hour to activate a rune. Once active the bearer will return to the circle, also any rune within 60ft of the first can be instantly activated. Due to the magics involved only living creatures and they're immediate possessions can be returned this way.

At 9th level circle can support up to 9 sigils and can open portals between them, allowing for greater movement of items.

> A portal can remain open for any length of time, it has no creature or weight limits. However, it has a maximum diameter of 9 feet and only one such portal can be open at a time.

### Outpost

As Hope's Gambit continues to grow to has the ability to create and maintain satalite outposts. These outposts confer all town perks, building perks, and mage circle upgrades.

### Storm Tunnel

A powerful arcane tunnel has been constructed that has generated a long, but safe passage way through the storm wall. This allows for easy access to the town and outside world.

### Permanent Settlement

Hope's Gambit has grown beyond its humble beginnings and is now the first major city in the outlands.

## Perks

Perks are granted to all explorers who have survived at least 1 expedition. Feats and skills must be explicitly chosen when the perk is taken. When a new perk is gained, 1 pervious perk may be exchanged for another. Some perks take more than 1 point. If a character already has the effect of a perk, the perk has no effect.
>Note that perks are chosen once and apply to everyone.

- A bonus skill at trained. If a character is already trained in that skill it advanced to expert. If they are already expert, this perk has no effect.
- A bonus skill feat
- A bonus general feat(2 points)
- 3 enhanced arcane spells added to the town library (Choose a base spell adn work with the GM to enhance it)

## Building Perks

All buildings start at level 1 and can be upgraded as the town expands. Each building has its own unique perks, but each only functions once per explorer per expedition.

#### Lodging

At first lodging in the town is little more than a series of long barracks, but proper sleeping quarters is high on the todo list.

As the Lodgings increase in level they get nicer and convey temporary hit points to explorers that set out from the town. This bonus is equal to 10% of the explorer's maximum HP at level 2 and it increases to 25% at level 3 and 50% at level 4.

### Cartographer

Little more than a tent with a long table when the town is founded, thsi building increases in size and sophistication as it increases in level. At each level after the first explorers who set out from Hope's gambit begin with 1 extra hero point and increase their maximu hero points by the same amount. This bonus increases to 2 and level 3 and 3 and level 4.

### Apothecarium

This building begins as nothing more than marks on the ground. As it levels up it becomes a building in its own right that eventually becomes a laboratory. At level 2 the healers there are able to supply each expedition that leaves with 3 potions of healing. At level 3 they can provide either 9 potions of healing or 3 greater potions of healing. At level 4 they can provide 27 potions of healing, 9 greater potions of healing, or 3 major potions of healing.

In addition starting at level 2 they provide a +10 bonus to longterm healing and can cast Lesser Restoration once a week.

### Titan Fist Forge

Andre's forge is as storied as he is, though it is lacking in certain areas. While he was able to bring his forge and anvil through the storm wall his workshop is little more than 4 posts and a roof. As it levels up, Andre's workshop becomes worthy of his name.

At level 2 and 4 Andre is able to craft items that are 3 and 5 levels higher than the town and at level 3 Andre can reduce the materials required to craft an item by 1.

### The Public House of Lost Sinners

This pub of ill repute is seen as a needed evil. It is a den of drinking and cheer that also houses all manor of vices to take the edge off of being in a new land. The pub is also home to the Black Market; which the consortium turns a blind eye to... so long as they still get their cut.

At each level after 1: Explorers gain +1 to morale and fear saves. In addition selling items to the black market generates and extra 5% GP per level.

### The Counting House of Kalistrade

This ediface to the greater philosophy of the consortium stands as Hope's Gambit's lone shrine. At each level after the first it grants 5/7/10% bonus experience when turning in valuables to the consortium.
