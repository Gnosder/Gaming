# Added and Adjusted rules

## Healing Surge
As an action, a character may spend up to half their HD and heal that amount. While taking a short rest a character recovers HD equal to their level and after a long rest they fully regain their HD.

## Attacks of Oportunity
Added "... Or when a creature is forcefully moved into your reach..."

## Defilement and Corruption
Added Deflinement and Corruption

## Holy
Added Holy tag to items and created systems to cleanse and create holy items

## Armor Piercing
Added Armor Piercing tag to weapons. An armor Piercing weapon has a +4 bonus to hit against non-magic Heavy Armor. If the weapon is magic it peirces magic armor. Some armor peiring weapons: Heavy Crossbow, War Pick, Maul
Note: This really just negates Heavy Armor against certain weapons, creating AC 'matchups'

## Loading
Adjusted the Loading tag to "A weapon with the loading descriptor can fire only one shot per round, regardless of the number of attacks you can make."

## Rune Stones
Only Lightborn can use Runestones. Magically enchanted runes that can be affixed to items to grant them further power.
Non-magic items may have 1 runestone max. Magical items may have an additional rune based on their tier. Sometimes a runestone may be damaged, in this case it takes a day of work and proficiency with 'Enchanters tools' to fix it.

## New Items
Enchanter's tools/kit/workshop
    Allows for enchanter profession checks
Stopped Aether
    Can be consumed to restore 1d4 HD to a target. Other grades exist and only 1 can be safely consumed an hour. If more than one is consumed, there is a risk of self-immolation.
    Some grades of stopped Aether can restore spell slots.
