# Titan Rage

A living world and setting that spans ages.
Each age is defined by and ended by a calamity. Each calamity is either local or global (thus different areas may be in different "ages").
Global Calamities are Astral calamities, while local are reffered to as Umbral Calamities. Most astral alamities are not known as such (it's hard to know what is trulely global and what is not).

## World Summary
- Name: Aglia
The world has had many names throughout the ages, but Aglia is the most common and well known. The world itself is predominatley water with 6 continents and a few vast Archeplagos. Much of the events of the world take place around the "Trade Sea", a calm expanse of water bordered by 4 of the continents and one of the island chains.
There were 6 shards, known as Creation Shards or Catalysits, created by the Sundering. 4 Old Ones were imprisoned on the world. The world is sentient, but fully occupied with keeping the Old Ones contained.

## Astral Calamities

### The Age of Gods

The Gods of reality finally triumphed in their long war with the Chaos Gods (Old Ones). While they could not kill the Old Ones they could imprison their weakened essences. They choose a dead world to be the prison and trapped the Old gods there. The power of Gods' working began to leak out and gave rise to life on the world.

### The Deliverance

A great battle was waged in the heavens above the world, a rouge God attempted to free the Old Ones. At its end the rouge God was killed and the remnants of his spark, a shard of pure creation fell onto the world. The shard pulled land from the endless sea, massivly increaseing the world's landmass, and uplifted many species that called the world home.

### The Sundering

The shard of Divinity (from the preveous age) was broken into several peices. Each was claimed by a different kingdom which coveted the others. Endless wars followed. The world was also broken by the sundering.

### Unity of the Ancients

An-anti calamity that still changed the face of the world. Ancient peoples came together in unity (after many bloody wars and rebellions) to create a world spanning utopia. The shards were reunited, but not reformed.

### The Great Flood

A flood caused by an influx of water aspect Aether from off world (Supernova expel aether whih can devistate worlds it does not outright destroy.) Drowned much of the world. Many species were lost, but some areas of the world were untouched.

### Wrath of the Maker

An island nation, Zratcha, became the center of a massive war (they battled over a shard). At its end the shard was destroyed which created the Aetheric Wound known as the "Storm's Cowl" which regularly causes massive storms (high storms) that devestate the area.

### The Darkening (Chaos and Eldritch Introduced)

An Old One gained enough power to reach beyond its prison and speak to a mortal. This mortal became know as the "Maddened Eye" and drew to himself a vast cult which he untimatley sacrificed in an attempt to free the Old One. His plan failed, but only just. It ripped open a hole from which Outsiders and other Eldritch beings emerged. It also released the Dark Water of the Ink Sea and "burned" the sky in the north. The gate is currently closed, but not locked.
