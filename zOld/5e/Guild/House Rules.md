# House Rules

This is a collection of rules I usually adopt in my games. They range from simple to complex. With each rule I'll note how easy it is to adopt and how much it can disrupte a game as well as why I use them.

## Simple Inspiration

Very Easy. Fully GM Facing.

Lots has been said about inspiration (at least at my tables) and I would probably have an opinion on it if I ever even remembered about it. I always forget to grant inspiration in play and my players rarely remind me (or only one does so they end up as the only one who ever gets it). This effectivly means I've removed it from my games which robs characters of a useful boon. While there are lots of ways to "fix" this problem, here is the one I use most often: I don't. This does not mean I "X" it out completly I don't use "Inspiration" instead I've become much more lenient with granting advantage.

## Advanced 'Vantage

Harder to use than the normal system, but not by much. Fully GM Facing

Advantage and disadvantage is a simple and elegant system. However the simplicity of this system can result in some strangeness. 
    "Teemo takes aim at the fleeing Goblin. He knows it's going to be a hard shot since the Goblin is at the max range of his bow (Disadvantage), and it's a very windy day (Disadvantage). To make the shot easier he asks the party wizard to cast Darkness around him. While he is now blind (Disadvantage) the Goblin can no longer see him (Advantage). This makes his attack roll a stright d20 roll."
This scenario is, ultimatley, a farce. Anyone can see that this is silly and that, rules be damned, Darkness should not make this shot easier. This is an absurd edge case that showcases how the system's ease of use can become silly. A simple change I often use is to count the instances of advantage and disadvantage and apply which ever is greater. Rather than adding only one and then canceling out 1 for 1. For example:
    "Teemo takes aim at the fleeing Goblin. He knows it's going to be a hard shot since the Goblin is at the max range of his bow (Disadvantage), and it's a very windy day (Disadvantage). To make the fun he asks the party wizard to cast Darkness around him. While he is now blind (Disadvantage) the Goblin can no longer see him (Advantage). He now has 3 instances of disadvantage and only 1 of advantage, thus his final attack will be made with disadvantage."


## Popcorn Initiative

Easy to use, harder to teach

There are countless ways to count and track initiative. In fact it seems that most games put their own spins on it. Well here is my spin. I use a system I call "Popcorn initiative" that I first encountered in the game Marvel Heroic and since adapted it to my own preference.

In this system everyone rolls initiative as normal and the character that rolls highest goes first. After their action they get to choose who goes next. They can choose any character in the encounter regardless of affiliation. Meaning they can choose enemies and neutral parties. The GM must tell them their options, though may obfuscate different options if needed. E.G. "You can choose Teemo or Rouge, you may also choose one of the 2 gnolls you are fighting or the mystery option. (Which in this case is gnoll reinforcements)"

Why is this useful? What are some reasons to use this? Why would a Player ever choose an enemy?

Good questions. The first thing to remember is that in this system whoever goes last in a round chooses who goes first in the next. So it the Evil Lich goes last in the round they can choose themselves to go first in the next, effectivly going twice in a row!

This system also allows for stronger teamwork and planning. E.G. "I'm going to run up and feint at the Ogre, they Rouge can go and follow up with a sneak attack and then Teemo can close with an arrow." OR "We need to get the civilians out of here, let's let them go first and then I'll go to cover their retreat. Sound good?"


## Player Defense

As a GM large combats can become overwhelming, especially at higher levels. One thing I've done to simplify things is to pass as much rolling as possible off to the players. Not only do they enjoy being able to roll more dice, but I no longer have to make dozens of die rolls a round in addition to everything else I'm doing.

The key thing here is that enemies don't roll to hit characters, characters roll to defend. This is fairly easy to do. AC, which is normally 10 + Dex + Armor, turns into a modifier which is just Dex + Armor (or AC - 10). Enemey attacks which were previously modifiers of +X turn into static scores of 10 + X. Now instead of the GM rolling an attack against a character's AC the character rolls a defense against the enemies' attack. 

Thus attacks become:
    "The gnoll attacks Teemo, roll defence."
    "I roll 9 plus my defense of 8 for 17."
    "You defend against the Gnoll's attack."

Instead of:
    "The gnoll attacks Teemo. He rolls 16 is that higher than your AC?"
    "Nope, I have a 17."
    "The Gnoll misses."

Mathmatically both scenarios are the same. There is still the same chance to hit and miss. The key difference here is WHO is rolling. Under this system the player rolls to defend.
