Post mortem
	Kobolds are evil and hateful. Blackstone clan of Black chromatic kobolds (acid). Used to living in the deepdark, hate “warm bloods' 'and want to reclaim world for dragon-kind. There are only 4 left after a few failed raids against a necromatic fungal growth (the flood from Halo). Pinched between Humans, Flood, and a deep dwarf outpost.
