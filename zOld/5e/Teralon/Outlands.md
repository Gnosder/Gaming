## Contract

*The contract you signed to embark on this expedition. The page you signed is a single sheet of parchment that contains the following information:*

I __[Name]__, attest that I have read the provided contract and accept its provisions. While the summary below has been provided for me, I understand that all disputes or questions will pertain to the contract itself and not the summary.

In accepting this contract I agree to: travel beyond the "storm wall" to the newly discovered land of "Outlands" and the Consortium's outpost "Hope's Gambit". I agree to assist the Consortium with its goals in the region including exploration and recovery of lost treasures. As an adventuer I will be left in charge of planning expeditions into the "Outlands" and dealing with dangerous fauna. I will not be required to assist with the day to day work at "Hope's Gambit". I agree to do this for no less than 6 months.

In exchange for this work the Consortium agrees to: Provide a monthly salary 50 pieces of gold, as well as bonuses to be set by the local Consortium representative; Pay death benefits equal to the full worth of the contract plus 2 months, minus what has already been paid, to my next of kin should I perish; grant free room and board at "Hope's Gambit"; provide all necessary equipment and supplies "at cost"; grant access to services beyond the norm, such as access to the Legendary smith Andre Titanhammer and his unrivaled ability to craft powerful magical items.

*The actual contract is a thick, leather bound volume spanning 700 pages and filled with nigh-indecipherable legal speak.*

## Monster Crafting
Andre can craft magical items out of raw materials and monster parts.

Gathering

In order to gather monster parts, at least an hour plus another hour per size category above or below medium/small. At the end of that time the GM will call for a skill roll that pertains to the action being taken. 3 or more people working together reduce the time required by half, but do not confer a bonus to the roll.

Skill roll results:
- Critical Success: gain twice as many materials
- Success: Gain at least 1* material per size category of the target
- Failure: May attempt to gather materials one more time, but the resulting item is 2 levels lower than it otherwise would be. Failing the second check or if the material level would drop below level 1 the result is treated as a critical failure.
- Critical Failure: The source is ruined and nothing can be gathered from it.
*there's some funk in the gears right now, some monsters will give more materials, but none will give less
** i.e. solo monsters will give x4 mats, elite x2, normal x1, minions -1 tier. But PF2e doesn't use those tags.
Parts/Materials
Each material has a tier and one or more properties. The tier is determined by the strength or rarity of the source and its properties by what it is.
  > Example: A scale from a young black dragon might be "expert scale acid draconic" 

Crafting
Each item begins as a formula which will require a number of material properties of at least a specified rarity. There is some flexibility in which properties are required, confer with Andre. It takes Andre a day to craft each item. If Andre needs to change a formula around to take into account a new item or give it a new property, he will let you know how long that will take (usually one day per tier, but there are exceptions).

| Level | Tier | Properties |
| 1-4 | Basic | 7
| 5-9 | Expert | 8
| 10-14 | Champion | 9
| 15-19 | Master | 10
| 20 | Immortal | 11
>Consumable items require half as many tags and yield 2 items with a 50% chance of yielding a bonus item.

Lower tier materials may be upgraded to a higher tier at the cost of 2 materials and 1 catalyst for 1 higher tier material. Higher tier materials may be broken at a ratio of 1:3.

Crafting Example

> To make a Flamgetounge Greatsword which is a champion tier item would take 9 total properties of champion tier or higher. The needed properties are firex4, metalx4, forcefulx1. Thus Andre could use 4 red dragon scales (champion, scale, fire, draconic), [using scales in place of metal (he can probably do that)], and a rune of force (champion, rune, forceful).

## Scouting Reports

The following are listed the reports from our scout sorted by highest priority and most recent as decided by Bruno Medal, Marshal of Exploration. Reports that have been followed up on will be noted as such.

4/5

Shivanna -- Zone 0102 -- Wyvern Spotted. I only saw it at a distance, 3-400 feet, while it was feeding. The creature appeared to be a Flame Drake, though it had notable differences. It looked more draconic than the more avian drakes I'm used to seeing around Molden Heath. Bigger too, but not overly so [information puts the creature at large size]. I moved closer after it left, It was eating one of the boars of the area. Singed grass indicates that flame breath is likely. A sticky toxic looking substance was also found in the area. Could be venom? 


    Apothecary notes: Sample was inert upon analysis, possibly too old, no inference possible.

4/2

Vi -- Zone 0302 --A single, large structure half buried in the cracked earth. Appears to be pyramidal, though I can see only the top most parts. No entrance is available, but the stones should be easy enough to break through to make one. The stone does not appear native to the area, though that is as far as my expertise takes me. Suggesting follow up assessment, potential risk is unknown. No monster spore present.

4/1

Draven -- Zone 0303 -- I got surprised -- ambushed, if you will -- by small creatures that resemble Kobolds, but they have strange ruby like growths on their bodies, doesn't look comfortable. The creatures seemed curious, they spoke to each other in a chittering speech that I'm not familiar with, though I can say for sure that it's not any dialect of Goblin, or Beast Common. I suppose I made a sudden move, or at least one they did not like as the creatures fled to the south. I waited a few minutes and then followed their trail, gingerly so as to not spook any watchers they left behind. After a time I arrived at what I can only describe as a town. Though the buildings are small and crudely made of mud and stone their intent as long term housing seems clear. I was not able to stay long as I was spotted and decided to leave before provoking a martial response. Diplomacy possible, but tred with care, Kobolds are cunning and visious bastards.

4/3

Teemo -- Zone 0102 -- Came upon what appeared to be a nest. Though far larger than any I've ever seen. The nest was easily 20 feet wide and roughly ovular. Skeletal remains in nest indicate the owner is carnivorous and lack of tracks around the nest point towards the owner being avian. However there were no feathers or other avian features present in the nest. I found a scale that I returned to camp that didn't seem to fit any of the remains. Perhaps a flying reptile? or Wyvern?

4/1

Dianna -- Zone 0201 -- Followed game trail until terminus, found carcasses of several large animals -- possibly boar, but larger than normal -- trail of blood led to cave entrance. Seems of unnatural construction, too round, too smooth. 3 creatures spotted outside cave. Creatures are bi-pedal, around 5'6", weight indeterminate, they have an insectoid appearance. Red-brown chitonous exterior, hands end in pinchers. Look like small versions of the Umber Hulk drawings in Volo's Guide to Monsters, though less hulking and more sleek. Area seems to be a nest or community. Diplomacy possible.

## Navigate Outlands

This journal will be updated as more information becomes available, it is the best and most complete guide to Outlands available.

What do we need to do to fill out the guide?

We've broken the maps the we have into roughly 6 mile regions and numbered them for ease of reference. Scouts report any interesting finds they have and give suggestions for further study. What we need is for seasoned explorers to:

> follow up on scout reports

> clear dangerous monsters from the area around Hope's Gambit

  > Bounties will be paid by the Consortium rep for proof of kill

> investigate ruins and abandoned structures for Treasure

  > A percentage of gains will be paid out by the Consortium rep

> Engage in diplomacy with any friendly or non-hostile peoples discovered

  > Our objectives in the region are to recover lost relics and treasure that would otherwise be forgotten

  > to open new trade routes to the outside lands

  > to learn about other cultures and sciences

>  Assist with the growth of Hope's Gambit

### Building Points


At each level, including the first the outpost generates enough prosperity to upgrade one building. Note that a building cannot reach its 4th and final tier until outpost level 9. A list of buildings and their upgrades is below.


### Perks


Starting at 3rd level and every other level there after the outpost provides a perk to all explorers that have a base there. A list of perks is below.


### Crafting


The legendary smith Andre has brought his equally legendary titan fist forge to Hope's Gambit. He can make items in a fraction of the normal time and is well suited to using the materials of this strange land. He can craft any item of any level so long as he has been supplied with the proper materials. Monster materials and their rules can be seen below.


### Maps


One of the first building set up in Hope's Gambit was a cartographer which also serves as a defacto command tent. Any returning expeditions can give over any maps/charts/etc and they will be added to the master map.


### Scouting Reports


The consortium sometimes sends out scouting parties that can, if they return, give a basic idea as to what to expect. Due to the inherent danger of the area there is a 1 in 10 chance, per hex, that the scouts do not return.


### Black Market


Shady dealers have found their way into Hope's Gambit, they'll buy items at a premium. Any gold gained from the black market won't help the town upgrade, but can be spent on importing materials for crafting.


### Mage Circle


A circle of arcane spellcasters has begun mapping the leylines of the outlands. Starting at 3rd level they provide explorers up to 3 sigils that, when placed in a location of sufficient power, can allow limited teleportation between the sigil and town.


> Teleportation can effect up to 9 creatures or items of medium size or smaller. Each discreat item counts as 1 creature. (Crates can be useful here). Each sigil can be used to teleport once every hour.


At 5th level they can craft powerful runes of returning. Once used, a character cannot benefit from the rune again for 1 week. These runes are given to every explorer that can benefit from them when they leave town.


> It takes 1 hour to activate a rune. Once active the bearer will return to the circle, also any rune within 60ft of the first can be instantly activated. Due to the magics involved only living creatures and they're immediate possessions can be returned this way.


At 9th level circle can support up to 9 sigils and can open portals between them, allowing for greater movement of items. Further, the sigils can be placed anywhere that is not magically desolate.


> A portal can remain open for any length of time, it has no creature or weight limits. However, it has a maximum diameter of 9 feet and only one such portal can be open at a time.


### Outpost


As Hope's Gambit continues to grow to has the ability to create and maintain satalite outposts. These outposts confer all town perks, building perks, and mage circle upgrades.


### Storm Tunnel


A powerful arcane tunnel has been constructed that has generated a long, but safe passage way through the storm wall. This allows for easy access to the town and outside world.


### Permanent Settlement


Hope's Gambit has grown beyond its humble beginnings and is now the first major city in the outlands.

## Perks


Perks are granted to all explorers who have survived at least 1 expedition. Feats and skills must be explicitly chosen when the perk is taken. When a new perk is gained, 1 pervious perk may be exchanged for another. Some perks take more than 1 point. If a character already has the effect of a perk, the perk has no effect.
>Note that perks are chosen once and apply to everyone.


- A bonus skill at trained. If a character is already trained in that skill it advanced to expert. If they are already expert, this perk has no effect.
- A bonus skill feat
- A bonus general feat(2 points)
- 3 enhanced arcane spells added to the town library (Choose a base spell adn work with the GM to enhance it)


## Building Perks


All buildings start at level 1 and can be upgraded as the town expands. Each building has its own unique perks, but each can only be used once per explorer per expedition. All building perks end after completeing an expedition.


### Lodging


At first lodging in the town is little more than a series of long barracks, but proper sleeping quarters is high on the todo list.


As the Lodgings increase in level they get nicer and convey temporary hit points to explorers that set out from the town. This bonus is equal to 10% of the explorer's maximum HP at level 2 and it increases to 25% at level 3 and 50% at level 4.


### Cartographer


Little more than a tent with a long table when the town is founded, thsi building increases in size and sophistication as it increases in level. At each level after the first explorers who set out from Hope's gambit begin with 1 extra hero point and increase their maximu hero points by the same amount. This bonus increases to 2 and level 3 and 3 and level 4.


### Apothecarium


This building begins as nothing more than marks on the ground. As it levels up it becomes a building in its own right that eventually becomes a laboratory. Starting at level 2 the healers and alchemests here can grant 2/3/4 healing potions of a level comparable to the explorers per expedition. They may instead grant twice that number of potions of any lower level. They can also craft potions if given the correct materials(this crafting is similar to Andre's).


### Titan Fist Forge


Andre's forge is as storied as he is, though it is lacking in certain areas. While he was able to bring his forge and anvil through the storm wall his workshop is little more than 4 posts and a roof. As it levels up, Andre's workshop becomes worthy of his name.


At level 1 Andre can craft items of a level no higher than the town's level. At level 2 and 4 Andre is able to craft items that are 3 and 5 levels higher than the town and at level 3 Andre can reduce the materials required to craft an item by 1.


### The Public House of Lost Sinners


This pub of ill repute is seen as a needed evil. It is a den of drinking and cheer that also houses all manor of vices to take the edge off of being in a new land. The pub is also home to the Black Market; which the consortium turns a blind eye to... so long as they still get their cut.


At each level after 1: Explorers gain +1 to morale and fear saves. In addition selling items to the black market generates and extra 5% GP per level and grants town xp equal to 10% of the item's value.


### The Counting House of Kalistrade


This ediface to the greater philosophy of the consortium stands as Hope's Gambit's lone shrine. At each level after the first it grants 5/7/10% bonus experience when turning in valuables to the consortium.


## Other Buildings and Features


### The Storehouse


This small building is little more than a warehouse with an attached office. It is fully staffed by consortium clerks and quartermasters. They take care of food and supplies in the town, requesting more from out the Outlands as needed. They offer ample secure storage space to explorers and can requesition items Andre cannot make, rare resources not found in the Outlands, or deliver mail to the outside world.


### Cliff of the Divine


While the counting house is the only shrine the consortium has built in Hope's Gambit it is by no means the only one allowed. A prime space has been set aside for the worship of the Gods as well as materials for the construction of shrines and gathering places.


### Field of Strife


A small area outside of town has been set aside for martial training.


### River of Storms


An offshoot of the river Gi'ad that flows through the Storm Wall. It is swift and prone to flooding, where once it drained out into the sea it now leads to a shallow basin that will, eventually, become a lake.


### Unused land


Hope's Gambit is small and the Outlands is not. There is plenty of space available for building and expansion.
