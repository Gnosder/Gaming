Mostly agrarian, absolute feudal monarchy, large collective of agri-socal druids. Capital city of WIndhurst seat of the monarchy.

Overview
	Is a small peninsula to the south of Kaar and surrounded by the Central Baticsia Ocean. In the north the landscape is dotted with hills, mountains, streams and lakes while the south is mostly flat with gently rolling hills. The region gets around 25 inches of rain a year and so is very green in the summer and coated in snow in the winter.
The area has strong commerce thanks to its many rivers which allow easy transportation of goods and its vast forests.
[Similar to real world Denmark in the south and Sweden in the North]
History
	Mostly known as a feudal state Aglia is home to noble houses and knights. Its history is full of civalrous warfare. It was breifly invaded by the Virmari empire, but was able to repel the assault.

The King has a council, the house of lords is overseen by the High Lord (member of kings council) and populated by nobles/their representatives, the commons are overseen by the People’s Prince (member of king’s council) and populated by guilds, mayors, and their representatives.
Economy
	The primary output of the region is grain (rye), with Hops, stone (particularly gypsum and Quartz), lumber (pine and spruce), and gold rounding it out. Most goods are unprocessed but beer, gold-crafts, and other arts are also produced.
