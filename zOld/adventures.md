# Spirit of the City

## Tag
    Modern Supernatural Mystery Systemless

## Summary
    A young college student attempted to summon a knowledge spirit to help her study. The summoning failed and the student was possesed by the spirit. Now the spirit is being hunted by vampires and another, darker, spirit and the summoner's soul is cast adrift and fading fast.
## Background
    Knowledge spirits have incredible value, anyone whos knows they exist would kill to possess one and so the secrets of summoning them are tightly guarded. Mindy Donovan is a third year vetrianry student who has begun to fall behind. Desperate for help she turns to her knowledge of the occult, gained from her Mother who was a skilled hedge witch. She attempts to summon the spirit Arada (one her mother had breifly used years before), but the summoning goes awry when another spirit follows Arada and attempts to capture her.
## Aside
    This adventure is designed to be system agnostic. Care will be given to assist the GM as much as possible
