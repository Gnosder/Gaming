## Actions and Consequences

Declare action.
GM determines resolution.
    If a roll is required it will be d20 + a stat + any situational modifiers against a static DC.
    Degree of success: If you beat a DC by 5 or more it's a critical success, if you fail by 5 or more it's a critical failure

Attacking:
    Roll d20 + Attack Bonus against target's defense.
    Meet or beat is a success. You deal damage to the target.
    Fail by 5 or more, the target may counter attack.
    Otherwise, the attack fails to deal damage, but also does not generate a counterattack.
Defending:
    Roll d20 + Defense against the target's attack.
    Beat by 5 or more, you take no damage and may counter attack.
    Fail, you take damage.
Saving:
    Roll d20 + save against the save DC.
    Fail, suffer effect.
    Pass, Resist Effect.
Skilling:
    Roll d20 + skill against skill DC.
    Pass, attain result.
    Fail, do not attain result.
    Fail by 5 or more, critical failure.

Stamia and Wounds
    Each character has stamina and wounds. 
    Stamina is drained when taking damage, casting spells, or preforming some tasks.
    When your stamina is reduced to 0, you gain a wound and a surge.
    Wounds come in 3 severities:
        Diminished; in the process of healing, can recover quickly
        Fresh; most wounds when received, fresh and aggrivated
        Critical; death is most certain without aid, difficult to recover from.
    Magical healing can turn a fresh wound into a diminished wound, but recovering a critical wound is beyond all but the most potent magic.
    Recovery Rate; each time you recover stamina either through healing, a surge, or rest, you regain this amount; equal to 1/4 your total stamina (round down).

Fate
    A character can spend a fate point to reroll a check OR to turn a critical failure into a failure.
