# 10 Candles

## Set up The game
"This is a game about telling a story. The story that you will
tell is not a kind one, and far from a happy one. It is the
sort of story that has sharp edges. The kind that lingers
long after it’s gone, nesting in nightmares and drifting on
every shadow. The kind that no one wants to tell. The kind
that needs to be told.
This is a story is about what happens in the dark. This is a
story about survivors trying to light up their little corner
of the world and do something meaningful within it in the
few hours they have left. This is a story about desperation.
It is a story about people like you and I fighting back
against the darkness, only to inevitably and inescapably be
consumed by it.
"Your characters will die. Though their
endeavor may be doomed to fail, it is our duty to make
this story of their struggle as meaningful as possible."


## Dead Radio

"You all know the basics. Ten days ago the
world went dark. Five days ago They came. Here’s
your module for tonight: Dead Radio."

"No one’s coming. Not anymore. The radio’s gone dead,
and you’re on your own now. There’s only one option left:
Fort Victor. All the chatter on the radio seemed to imply
that Victor's the place to be. But you’re a good hour out;
over the river and through the woods – literally. Everyone
else has packed up and left by now.
The Town Hall’s fallout shelter is slim pickings. Not
enough food to last the next few days, not to mention
the fact that the generator’s been acting up. Maybe a few
supplies could still be scavenged, but one thing’s for sure:
it’s time to leave."

Areas of Note: Fallout shelter, bridge out of town, dark woods, Victor

Goal: Discover what has become of the military forces at Fort Victor

## Getting Started


Each player chooses a virtue and a vice, then passes the virtue to the left and the other right.

Each character creates a concept or idea for their character. Concepts include Name, looks, and concept.

Each character creates a moment

        "I will find hope..."

Each character creates a brink; and pass it left.

        "I have seen you..."

The GM gets one brink at random from the "They" pile.

Alt: Each character get one virtue, one vice, one moment, and one brink at random from the pile instead of making one.

Create a stack for play. The brink is always on the bottom, the rest arranged however the player wants, no more than one moment should be on top for the table to start.

### Them Brinks

“I have seen Them...”

    “... move like shadows.”

    “... shapeshift in front of me.”

    “... howl at the pale moon.”

    “... consume the dead.”

    “... possess the living.”

    “... and I know this is all an experiment.”

    “... and They serve the witch of the woods.”

    “... and They are the gods made manifest.”

## How to play
Conflict rolls: roll all the dice, if at least one 6 is rolled it succeeds.

    Success: Remove all 1s rolled from the pool for the rest of the scene.

    Fail: End the scene and darken a candle.
New Scenes: 

    Establish truths. A truth is a simple, discreet thing.

        The first is always "These things are true: it is dark"

        The last is always "We are alive" until all the candles are out.

    Refill the pool up to the number of lit candles.

Traits:

    Burn a trait to reroll all 1s. No more than 1 trait may be burned per scene.

Moment:

    Make a conflict roll to discover your hope. Pass you gain a hope die. Fail, end scene.

Embrace Brink: Reroll failed roll or failed narration. Pass play continues. Fail, burn brink, lose hope, end scene.
