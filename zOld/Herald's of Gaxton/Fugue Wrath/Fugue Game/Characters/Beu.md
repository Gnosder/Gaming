## Abilities

Quick Learner: If you have no points in a non-combat skill, your first point spent gives you a score of +2 rather than +1. Further, silver and time costs to receive training are reduced by 25%.

Masterful Expertise: When using FP to reroll a failed non-combat skill check the FP is not spent if the second roll succeeds.

Hide in Plain Sight: Can attempt to hide even if there is nothing around to hide in.
