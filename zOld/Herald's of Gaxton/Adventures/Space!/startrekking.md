A TNG styled jaunt to a new planet.

Distress call from world listed as inhabited. Minimal life signs detected. AI (Failsafe Proxy; Alfie, Happy only) asks for assistance locating her crew (they ded). The world: Tamerna; home of the Tamernirs a custacian race.

The chart data was given to the Eliksni by a minor race, the Hokrax, and is several centuries out of date. Failsafe is using a trade language to communicate though she is fluent in many others.

The ship, The Uchre, was manned by Avan (from Avina) explorers who went to the planet to investigate reported sismic activity. They found the world dead and lethal levels of toxins in the atmosphere (Primarily carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen Chloride) resulting in a greenhouse heated acidic environment that corods most metals.

The atmosphere was saturated with radition and fatal levels of CO2 by war and industry, the populace retreated to undersea presurre domes. A geothermal pipline was sabatauged by rebels resulting in a super volcano eruption that wiped out the planet. The volcano continues to erupt churing large ammounts of undersea nitrogen into the world further increasing the greenhouse effect.

The Uchre was investigating the eruptions and found large Amonium Nitrate crystals as well as particularly dense and pure Sulfur Diamonds when a quake collapsed a tunnel on the crew, killing them all.

The quake was caused by Tamernian survivors that are mining the Diamonds and using the unique pressure cooker atmosphere to further refine them. They are opportunists and scavengers. The intent was to steal the Uchre and escape the planet with a wealth of diamonds and tech, however the quake released a bioweapon that zombified the survivors before they could escape.

Volcanic Mine, Crab People Zombies, Insane (Helpful, but very illegal) A.I., Large store of hard to synthasize Sulfur Diamonds, Cache of pre-extenction Tamernian data.
