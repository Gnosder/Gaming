I want characters to take 2 hits-ish

If a character starts with 8 stress and most will have 4 armor that means each hit should do 6 or 3-9.

A tanky character might have 12 stress, 6 armor, 4 shielding

Armor is ablative, but doesn't matter too much?

2-4 wounds plus armor (1-3,4)

Remove base bonus from defense. It's only skill.
