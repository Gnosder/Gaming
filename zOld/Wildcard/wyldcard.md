# Stand Off

Drawing cards vs rolling dice. Mostly the same, diffferent feel?
ttrpg that uses cards instead of dice. Has an escalation mechanic at the start of conflicts to set the stakes -- risk and reward.

The deck takes the place of dice and has the same distribution. Each participant in a conflict draws from the same deck.

A second deck of 'wyld' cards that are gained and spent similar to grit/willpower/edge/inspiration.

When a conflict begins, each person gets dealt a card, face down. Starting with the petiontioner, they may raise, call, or fold. 
    Fold means they withdraw from the conflict, and may not suffer harm.
    Call means they don't escalate and are happy with the current stakes. 
    Raise means they escalate the conflict, increaseing the risks.

Escalation:
    Has 5 levels, defined by the highest number of cards held (note this does not include wyld cards)

    Level 1: This is the starting level for any conflict. It's more akin to a simple disagrement than a battle. 
    Level 2:
    Level 3: This
    Level 4:
    Level 5: At this level someone will die. This is the highest level of escalation and represents lethal consequences.

    TODO: Define escalation levels and consequences.

    When cards are flipped total the results and compare. Before cards are flipped, may add 1 wyld card. 

## Threat (Escalation) Levels

What does each escalation level look like?

5 is lethal and results in at least one death.
4 is a major consequence and HP damage on fail and continue until beaten 
3 is a minor consequence and HP damage on fail and continue until beaten (standard)
2 is a minor consequence on fail and then ends
1 is not used. all conflicts start at 2. 

Beaten = submit or restrain or kill

### Ambush

If an attack is made from ambush, the attacker decides starting escalation level

## Wild Cards

Players can't have more than 2 at a time. If you ever have more than 2, discard down to 2.
Gain a card when you fold or win a conflict or as a reward for good play or a quest.
GM's can have a number of wild cards = to the 'stakes' of the adventure.
    E.g. to save the world from destruction would be a 5, to get revenge for a murder would be a 4 or 5, to find and arrest a murderer would be a 2 or 3.
The GM gains a wild card when one of their NPCs wins a conflict or when a conflict goes above the adventure stakes.

## Stakes

Each adventure, campaign, quest, or scene has stakes. These stakes can change as situations change and can be different for different people.
That said the stakes of the adventure as a whole should be self-evident and don't change much. Stakes for a scene can change based on actions taken within a scene.

## Scenario 1

Edric enters Ruin of Gods gambling den. He wants to meet his contact, a fence named Stell, and offload some stolen goods. He sees Stell seated at a booth and walks over to him.

"This seat taken?" Edric says as he sits down.
"Why ask if you're just going to take it anyways?" Stell eyes the small satchel Edric carries under his arm. "I hope that's not for me. Your coin isn't spending as well as it used to."
"That's news to me. Things went fine on my end, why don't you tell me what happened on yours?"
"I'm shiny, squeaky clean. Perhaps you're slipping if you think you're spotless. Regardless, I've got no business with you."
"You going to tell me what you know, or are you just going to let me twist?"
"No. I don't think I will. I'm sure you have other contacts you can harass."

...

Stell is holding out on important info he doesn't want to share, Edric wants to know what happened to his reputation. Because Stell 'put up the wall' by saying no, he is the aggressor. Both players are dealt 2 cards, this is the start of their conflict. If Edric wins he gets what he wants, otherwise he does not. The aggressor goes first, Stell calls. He doesn't think Edric will take this to blows in the gambling den. Edric raises and is delt a new card, he's betting on Stell folding. Stell, surprised by Edric's willingness to escalate, folds and Edric follows suit. Stell tells Edric what has happened, that his old partner is working with the police and that Edric is 'hot'. Stell will remember this and gains a wild card.

> The one who begins the conflict is the person who says 'no'.
> Players can see their own face down cards. Players may add a single wildcard to their hand in place of another card.
> If a player folds their opponents may accept or decline. If a fold is declined it counts as a call.

In this example, if Stell had raised...
Stell raises and is dealt a third card. Edric underestimated Stell's resolve, but feels he is now comittied, so he calls. Stell calls as well. The hands are revealed, showing Stell with a 15 and Edric with a 17. Edric wins and since he was the first to call, narrates his action and then his victory.
'Edric grasps Stell's head and slams it into the table with a loud crash.' Stell takes damage and suffers a bloody nose. He tells Edric what he heard and leaves to tend his nose.

In this example, if Stell had raised and Edric was dealt bad cards...
Stell raises and is dealt a third card. Edric underestimated Stell's resolve, he looks at the cards he was dealt and sees 2 ones. Even with a good card, he doubts he can win. Edric folds and Stell does likewise. Stell wins and decides the outcome, but Edric gains a Wild Card.
"This isn't the place, Edric. Now, run along and bother someone else."

In this example, if Edric had bad cards but had a wild card...
Edric looks at his cards and sees 2 ones, but he knows he has a twenty card that he can play in place of one of them. He decides to call. Stell folds, he doesn't want to damage his working relationship with the den by spilling any blood. Edric folds as well, Stell tells him what he wanted to know. Though Stell is none too pleased by the outcome and gains a wild card.

### Scenario 3 - Orc attack

A party of adventur food (fighter, cleric, theif, wizard) comes face to face with a group of savage orcs. The orcs are clearly aggressive and homicidle. The party, likewise, desires the sweet xp of the orcs. Thus someone is likely to die. However, that doesn't automatically mean the standoff will go to level 5 or that there will even be a standoff. Let's play it out.

Both parties square up, they both expect and want violence. A standoff here doesn't make much sense, instead the game goes to combat rounds and initiative is rolled. This is because both parties want the same thing (violence), there is no conflict (save the one that is incipient, but that is more a contest) for a standoff.

#### What if the party doesn't want to fight the orcs?

The GM of the game is smart and hasn't tied gaining XP to something dumb like killing orcs. The party has no reason to want to fight the orcs. In fact they would prefer not to, so that they can save resources for the dungeon delve that they know is coming up. The party leader asks the orcs to stand aside and let the pass. The orc leader says 'no' and with an evil grin brandishes his brutal great axe.

Both parties are delt 2 cards. In this case the orcs put up the wall by saying 'no' and so go first. They want blood to be spilled so they raise and are delt a third card. The adventuers are fine going to 3, so they call and so get delt a third card. The orcs are frothing at the mouth now and raise again, they are delt their forth card. The adventurers are pretty sure they can win in a fight, but don't want to risk the major consequence 4 cards represents, so they fold. The orcs, wanting blood, don't accept and so both groups call. The orcs reveal their 4 cards with a total of 46, the adventuers reveal their 3 cards with a total of 44. The orcs win and so deal damage to the party and impose a minor consequence, they also act first in the ensuing combat*. The adventurers get to decide who takes the damage.

The orcs bellow and charge, the fighter steps between the theif (their 'leader') and the head orc. He takes 5 damage from the orc's vicious blow and suffers damage to his armor (this damage will persist until repaired via magic or a short rest). Combat now begins.

* Maybe instead of going first, it should give a bonus to init.

### AMBUSH

A group of sneaky goblins has been stalking the adventuers. While the latter has been resting following a battle with orcs, the formor is getting ready to ambush them. This will never result in a standoff as the nature of an ambush lies counter to the idea of a standoff. Thus the encounter will be run using the standard ambush rules.

## Does a standoff have to result in combat?

No, if neither party wants it, combat will not ensue. If, however, one party wants to fight they will attempt to do so.

Standoffs work best for non-combat conflicts, but can be used to determine the initial position of a combat.

## Take Aways

Those who are willing to risk the most can gain the most.

## Misc

This doesn't allow for skill bonuses, is that ok? I think it is, this determines position and stakes.
Either that or add skill and situational modifiers to cards

It this useful as a game tool or as a GM tool? Should players see it or should the GM just be aware of it?
