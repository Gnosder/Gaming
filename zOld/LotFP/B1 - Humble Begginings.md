# Humble Beggining in a Ruined World
	Aka the Rock Tumbler
	This adventure is a “Tumbler” to sort the wheat from the chaff of characters. All “prospects” are level 0 unclassed hirelings. They are delving into a tomb beneath a cemetery that is newly infested with wrath seed under the patronage of Ser Broderic “the Magnificent” Strohmensch.
	Ser Strohmensch has also hired 2 mercenaries who will protect you while you harvest Wrath Crystals, valuable crystals prized by magic-users for their chaotic properties which only grow within Wrath. **Spoiler** It will not go well.
	Some wrathful dead quickly overwhealm the mercenaries and you are forced to flee deeper into the cemetary which, it turns out, is actually cistern — an area corrupted by wrath that, through a planar tear, leads into the churning chaos. The only way out is to find the wrath heart — a VERY valuable crystal that has ripped open the portal.
	See chapter 2 — characters for rules to create characters for a tumbler and for post tumbler advancement.

## At the tomb
	"You stand, milling around with a dozen or so other beings, just outside an overgrown cemetery at the edge of the Yarma habitable zone. Among the foliage you see thin fibrous tendrils of wrath snaking out of the ground adding deep crimson highlights to the otherwise vibrant green. A man stands before you, your employer Ser Broderic Strohmensh the so called “magnificant”, he takes a deep breath of the earthy air and says “Friends, comrades, we have arrived at the site of our fortune! This cemetery hides beneath it a tomb of moderate size that is the perfect environment for the formation of wrath crystals. While Viggo remains here, I, along with Felix and Lennart, will protect you from any dangers found there while you, my brave companions, will carefully harvest all the wrath crystals with which we will make our fortunes and retire rich and fat. Now, onward to our destinies!” Felix and Lennard lead the way to the tomb, carefully picking their way through the wrath infested overgrowth. The tomb entrance is little more than a collapsed stone shack that, after moving the stones aside, reveles a stairwell going down into darkness and the air fills with the sweetened sulfur smell of wrath."

	"After lighting and passing out torches to everyone the two mercenaries begin to descend into the earth, weapons drawn, Felix with an iron banded mace and Lennart with his pistols. The stair way decends deep into the earth. Far deeper than you feel it should for a simple tomb. The walls of the stairwell spiderwebbed with crimson wrath growing out of cracks in the stone bricks. Bricks which eventually gives way to natural stone that seems to softly reflect the light of the torches.
	After an interminable amount of time the stairwell opens up into a small antechamber. The chamber is decorated in a strange style with Urns of an unfamiliar make clustered at the edges of the room, haphazardly placed. Garish geometric patterns adorn the walls of the room though their true nature seems hidden beneath the sinuous wrath which winds its way to two sarcophogi in the center of the room flanking a small altar. At the far side of the room two stone double doors stand slightly ajar. The stale air of the chamber mixes strangely with the sweetened sulfer smell of the wrath creating an atmosphear of Euphoric Dread. 
## The Antechamber
	"The group of you move gingerly into the room. Broderic directs a few of you to remove the lids from the sarcofogi while the mercenaries ready themselves to confront anything that might be in them. 'Let’s look inside these, there might be some blooms that we can harvest. Felix, Lennart, be ready in case the occupant takes offense to our presence.'"

	"On a count of 3 you slid the lid off one of the stone caskets. Looking down you see a skeleton wrapped in wrath with a crimson flower growing out of its mouth. Broderic directs one of you to GENTLY pick the bloom."
	
    **Someone should volunteer (or be voluntold) to do it** 

	"As you reach out to grasp the bloom the skeleton, who until this point was fully inert and for all intents inanimate, lunges up and…"
    defend vs 14. Pass: you narrowly pull your hand away as its jaws slam closed . Fail: The skeleton’s jaws slam closed around your wrist, cleanly severing your hand from your arm. Take 1d6 damage, save vs. paralyze (shock).

	"As you fall back the air fills with the sound of cracking bones, as the skeleton rises up, stone on stone, as the lid to the second sarcofogus slides off, the smell of burnt powder and the sound of a gunshot as Lennart fires at the first skeleton."
	
    "The next few moments blur as Felix shatters the skull of the first skeleton with his mace and Lennart screams as the second skeleton, having rapidly emerged from his casket, bites deeply into his neck, like some hunting beast. Blood sprays against Felix as he stumbles back, he raises his mace for a second strike as Lennart crumples to the floor.  The first skeleton, now headless, is somehow still standing and lunges at Felix knocking him off balance and pushing him against the altar. A scream of fear escapes him as he swipes desperately at the two skeletons. Bones crack and splinter each time his mace makes contact, but the skeletons seem unfazed. Finally the first skeleton collapses into a heap on the floor, but not before the second has opened a long and jagged wound in Felix’s side. He screams and with a final swing of his mace the second skeleton too crumples into a pile. Felix slides down the side of the altar, his breathing ragged and becoming weaker by the moment. As Felix breaths his last Broderic collapses, aghast, staring behind you. “It’s gone,” he stammers, “The stairs, the exit. It’s… gone.”
	"At this point both Felix and Lennart are dead as are both skeletons. The stairway the party took moments ago to descend into this space has vanished, leaving a smooth stone wall with the same spiderweb of wrath as the rest of the room."

### Examine
    The room is still. Two piles of bones on the floor are all that remins of the skeletons, the blooms that were in their mouths pulverized by the frantic attacks of Felix. The corpses of two mercenaries lie amongst the bones. The smell of blood adds a metalic tang to the sweet sulfer of the wrath. The lone doors stands partially ajar at the far end of the room.
    The altar has nothing of value on it.
### Loot:
    The urns are full of rotted fruit and grains. Amongst the remains of the skeletons you find a beaten pewter armlet and a golden tooth (DC 12). The mercenaries have: a brace of pistols (2 pistols) with 11 shot and a powder horn, an iron banded stone mace, a leather curias w/ helm, pikeman’s armor (w/o gorget, tassets, or helmet), 2 backpacks, 2 bedroll, shaving kit, simple repair kit, 4 torches, flint and steel, 3 survival knives, and sundry knicnacks.
### Exit: 
    The double doors at the end of the room open out into a short hallway that end abruptly at a brick wall. Red light shines through cracks in the masonry and a the sound of running water can be heard on the otherside of the wall. The brick wall blocks aaccess to the cistern proper.

### Broderick
	At this point Broderick is falling apart and descending into madness. His fragile ego cannot handle what has happened. He must check moral with each encouter and each time he is asked questions about Wrath or the Cistern. Failing a moral check requires him to check madness. If he makes it into the heart room he has a burst of maddness and attempts to take the heart. He gets attacked and killed by the shark demon.
	Broderick knows the following:
        * Cisterns rare are portals into the chaos.
        * Cisterns are created and powered by powerful wrath crystals called wrath heart.
        * Cisterns either collect wrath or send it out into the world.
        * The only way out is to go deeper and take or destroy the heart.
        * The chaos houses all kinds of horrors. Demons come in many forms.
#### Madness — 2d6 -1 per room explored
    1-3: He flies into a mad rage and attacks
    4-5: He goes fetal and rocks
    6-8: He remains lucid though does not speak
    9-10: He babbles about nothing
    11+: A burst of courage fills him. Treat as a successful moral save.

	
## Upper Cistern
    The cistern in a large cendrilical room 40' around and several hundred deep. The passageway opens onto a small ledge at the top of room that runs along the western side to another opening in the wall. From the ledge above it is possible to see the Wrath Heart far below. A red tinted waterfall cascades down the eastern side of the room from a large hole in the ceiling. The walls of the cistern pulse red and are almost competely covered in Wrath. The sweetness of the wrath is lost here as the room smells deeply of sulpher.
    The ledge that wraps around the room leads to Wrath Marsh.

## Wrath Marsh
    The lone reachable exit in the cistern opens impossibly into a large marsh. The doorway taken out of the cistern appears, on reflection, to be a weathered stone archway; looking in you can see the cistern, but it is clearly a portal of some sorts as one can walk fully around the archway.
    The marsh is several acres in diameter borded on all sides by still water a deep shade of Wrath red (swimming not advised). The marsh is populated by a variety of exotic looking flowering plants and decaying trees, all wrapped tightly in Wrath. (It appears that the wrath is devouring the trees and nourishing the flowers). Several bulging piles of moss billow gently in an unfelt wind. Deep in the marsh is a stone shack, Its lone door wrapped tightly with wrath. There is no lock or handle, but the door is shut tightly. An indentation in the center of door implies the existence of a rune of some variety. The indentation is surrounded by mossy handprints and a small trail leads away from the door as if something was dragged away. (Show puzzle 1: the path leads to one of the piles but the trail is crisscrossed by other similar trails and one section were all 3 meet is a puddle). The marsh is inhabited by 3 decay demons that look like shambling mounds. The demons are very lazy and wont bother anyone unless they bother it. One of the demons has the key to the exit, one of them thinks they do, and the third doesn't care. The demon with the key will stay still and only attack if attacked or its clear they want the key. The demon who thinks it has the key will attempt to flee if it thinks anyone is on to it, but it wont/can't go far. The third demon will take a lazy swipe at anyone who gets too close but wont seriously defend itself unless threatened. None of the demons are capable of speech and have the intellegence of a racoon.
    The stone shack houses another portal that opens into the winding tunnel.
    
## Winding Tunnel
    A natural tunnel cut by water with several dead ends. The water in the tunnel is infused with Wrath and the walls of the tunnel pulse with wrath. Water flows away from the exit and towards the portal and disapears into it. The exit opens up into the Wrath Heart's chamber.
    One of the dead ends has a large wrath crystal formation that can be broken into a number of pieces.
    A second dead end has a Lurker Demon (disgused as a stalagmite) in the center of a pool of water. The water flows out of the pool towards the marsh. The demon will attack if anything gets too close. It has a wrath bloom growing out of its base.
    The third and fourth dead ends are simply that.
    The Fifth leads to the Wrath's heart chamber.

## Lower Cistern
    The tunnel opens up back into the large cistern you were in before except this time you come out at the bottom. Far above you, you can see the ledge where you came in. In front of you suspended over a roiling pool of water (the waterfall falls into it) is the Wrath Heart, A blood red crystal the size of a pumpkin and pulsing with a sinister inner light. In the water is a shredder demon (shark) that will protect the heart. There is a doorway just to the right of the one they came out of that leads to Garden.

## Garden
    This room appears to be a garden of some sort. Several grow beds line the room and wrath crystals imbeded in the ceiling pulse their red light on the strange plants beneath. Roses and other common flowers are growing there and while there is non of the ubiquitous fibrous wrath surrounding them, they still seem infused with wrath -- their color a bit too red, their thorns a bit too sharp, and their floral scent a bit too acrid.
    There is a wrath posessed human tending the flowers. He is paranoid and agrressive but not stupid. He will try to protect the garden, but will not die for it. He remembers little of before he came to the cistern and knows only that he cares for the flowers. He wont leave the garden even to protect the heart.
    In the corner of the room is a small collection of tools: shears, spades, buckets, and other gardening paraphanelia, but also rope, wooden boards, hammers, nails.

## Wrath Touched
    Characters will inevitably come in physical contact with wrath. When touching physical wrath their corruption increases by 1 (once per 10 minutes, up to 7). Liquid wrath increases corruption by 2 on physical contact (once per 10 minutes, up to 7) or 3 on consumption (no cap). Each day may save verses poison to remove CON points of corruption (min 0).
    Every time corruption is gained 2d6. If you roll under your corruption score you gain a curse. If you have any corruption at all you have the "Intrusive Wispers" curse. After gaining 5 curses corruption can no longer decrease and at 7 curses you become a Wrath touched.
    Destroying a cistern reduces corruption by d6.

## Taking the Heart
    Once the heart is taken the cistern begins to collapse and everyone inside it is shunted back to their home plane a few rounds after the collapse begins.

## Viggo
    When the characters leave the tomb they encounter Viggo Fernand, Usher of the house of Strohmensh. He wants to learn what happened and where Broderic is. While he didn't much care for Broderic, the noble was his meal ticket. He still wishes to get paid and hatches an idea to pass one of them off as Broderic's heir. This would let them take over the estate and sell any goods they got from the cistern. He will take care of the details (the heir should be human, but doesn't have to be). Further, Strohmensh wasn’t the houses real name, it was one Broderic took because he didn’t like the original (as it reminded him of his father who was greatly disapointed in him). The actual name is open for the players to decide.

    Should the characters take Viggo up on his offer they gain control of the "House of Straw" for good and ill.
