# The House of Straw
	This once glorious house has fallen on hard times thanks to its previous owner Ser Broderic “the Magnificent” Strohmensch. This is the land “granted” to the “heirs” of Broderic. 

## The Demense has the following amenities:
    Manor w/ 5 rooms, kitchen, dining room, office, library, common area, covered garden
    Basement w/ storage, wine cellar, larder
    Stables (empty, room for 4 animals)
    Servant’s quarters
    Several acres of empty space
    A ruined stone wall (was more decorative than functional)
    3000 acres of land of which roughly 1500 is arable
## The estate begins with the following:
    Status: Destitute (-2 when hiring retainers)
    Butler (Viggo) — 115 sp a month (also coachman)
    Servant (Evert) — 50 sp a month (also serves as laborer and craftsman)
    1600 sp (40gp) in the coffers
    2100 gp in debt at 8% interest per month (simple, 120g)
    Wine cellar: empty
    Stables: empty
    Library: empty 
    Laboratory: empty
The estate is valued at 500 gp with a monthly upkeep of 5.9gp.
    (Upkeep per month: 1gp X # of residents  + wages + upkeep (year/12))
The estate generates an income of 10 gp a season from leasing X acres of the arable land.
The estate requires upkeep per season. Until an accountant and craftsman is hired it will cost 12 gp a season (~2% the value)
    (Values in the book list PER YEAR, divide the % by 4 to get the per season cost, roll per season)
On the last day of Fall taxes are due each year. Taxes this year ammount to 39 gp.
    (reroll per year or after hiring a new accountant)

## Expansions
The estate can have 5 buildings built on the land around it, the manor itself can have 7 upgrades and the stable can be improved twice.

Manor upgrades: 
	+ 2 Rooms (10’)
	+ Vault (10’)
	+ Room Size (20’)
	+ Room Size (40’)
Land Upgrades:
	Stable Expansion I (8 animals)
	Stable Expansion II (16 animals)
	Servant Quarters expansion (8 retainers)
	Servants Quarters (4 retainers)
	Laboratory (90’ per story)
    Library (90’ per story)
	Smithy (90’)
	Workshop
	Training Ground
	Chapel
	Servant Cottage (x2, 1 retainer each)

## Recomendation:
Hire an accountant and craftsman
A second servant is a good idea
A physician is a good idea as is an armorer
Laborers are needed for any large scale repairs
Alchemists, scholars, and animal handlers/coachmen should not be overlooked
The property has room for expansion
Can build training area, laboratory, expand the library, chapel, smithy, expand servant quarters, expand the stables
If the wall is repaired a guard house is a good idea
Wine is a good investment, in fact investing in the house not only adds to its value (but not taxes or upkeep) but also builds clout.

Due to the state of the manor all new retainers get -2 to hire. 
Destitute: -2
Illrepute: -1
Maintained: 0
Respectable: +1
Prosperous: +2
