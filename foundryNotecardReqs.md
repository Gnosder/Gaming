# Requirements for Foundry Index Card Mod

My idea is to have a mod that allows me to use index cards the same way I would at a physical table. When using this mod I would be using foundry as a 'campaign tracker' rather than a 'combat board'. Meaning it'd be more 'high level' or 'zoomed out' than previous games. Honestly, it's kind of like a cork board.

## Needs
I need to be able to add a new card to the table.
I need to be able to save created cards and use them later.
Cards need to have a space for and clearly display a title.
Cards need to have space for and clearly display one to a few bulleted notes.
Cards need to be linkable to a Foundry journal entry.
Cards need to be interactable on the board.

## Wish List

- Having multiple card layouts would be neat. It'd be cool if I could have some that are just Title and tags, some that can do an image title and tags, and some that have a more robust tag section. Maybe also a card that is just an image.
- It'd be really neat if the image could be interactable.
    - e.g. I make a card with a 'clock' or multiple check boxes and give it the title "The guards arrest you" and then as actions are taken to make the guards suspecious I can check off clock segments or check boxes to visually show how close the players are to getting arrested.
    - I already do things like this on my end, but I can't easily show them to the players.


## Example of cards in use:

The players travel to the Skull Bashed Inn to meet with a contact. I pull a blank index card and write "Skull Bashed Inn" on it as a title. I then give it a few notes "Seeker district; Run by Orcus (not that Orcus); Dive Bar". I place the card on the table to serve as reference. After the scene a player picks the card up and, on the back, writes "Met with Stephen Hammerbro, not sure he's on the level or at least all there. As sharp as a hammer. Gave 'quest' to find 'bandits'". After the game I pick the card up and put it with the others.

## Honestly...

Something like a macro that:
- creates a journal entry (or uses one already made)
- Creates a token that is a box with a black boarder and a white background
- adds the journal entry's title in large text
- adds the first few lines of the entry as notes
- groups the box and text together so they can be moved and resized as one

Would be fine.
