# Dragons and Daring

A ttrpg system that is a mash up of all the things I like.

## What is this?

The design behind the game is a simple class / power system with most of character power being external. Levels only grant HP and a few other bonuses.

## Systems

### Attempst

Checks or Attempts are made with a d20. Basic attempts are just + stat. Skilled attempts are + stat + background + boons. Most attempts are skilled.

#### Critical Attempts

When an attempt rolls a natural 20 it is a critical and adds the ultimate die in addition to its normal effort.

#### Boons and Banes

Instead of getting misc bonuses to rolls characters gain boons and banes. They are added to rolls as extra d6s. Boons cancel out Banes 1 for 1. When rolled only the highest boon rolled is added to the check, the highest bane is subtracted.

### Health and Consequences

In this game characters have Stress and consequences. Stress works like HP in D&D. It goes down as damage is taken and up when it is healed. In world it represents ones ability to absorb punishent and mental fortitude. 
Player and 'heroic' characters also have consequences, they have 2 minor, 1 moderate, and 1 extreme. Each consequence has a stress value associated with it. Minor is worth 25% of ones max stresss. Moderate is worth 50% and extreme is worth 100%. Whenever a character takes stress they may instead suffer a consequence to absorb that much stress. Consequence represent real world harm recieved, this is real damage.
Each consequence also imposes 1 bane on every roll. Resonable treatment applied at regular intervals can negate this boon. When damage is taken a character may take a consequence to absorb some or all of that damage. Any extra damage is dealt to stress and can be mitigated with another consequence. 
If damage would reduce a character to less than 1 stress and they have an open consequence they must use it. If a character is out of consequence and would be reduced below 1 stress, they are dying.

#### Healing and Recovery
Stress heals naturally at a rate of 1 every 6 minutes or 10 an hour of activity. During a short rest, stress fully recovers. Magic can also recover stress.
Consequence have a minimum duration and can be removed after that period during a rest.
Minor consequences last for 1 day and can then be removed during a short rest.
Major consequences last for 1 week and can then be removed during a long rest.
Extreme consequences last for 6 months and can then be removed with extended treatment or rest.
Some magic can heal consequences, but it is difficult, costly, or slow.

#### Death
When a character has used all their consequence and has been reduced below 1 stress, they are dying. When a character begins to die, the GM rolls a d4 in secret. That is how many rounds before they die. Each round there after the character makes an unmodified luck attempt, on a natural 20 they recover 1 stress and awaken--it was just a flesh wound. Other characters may help stabalize a dying character either with magic, by healing at least 1 stress, or by spending an untinurrupted period giving medical aid. This period lasts until the target regains at least 1 stress, typically 6 minutes. If the medical aid is disrupted for any reason the target begins dying again and the counter resumes. Particularly skilled medics may add up to 2d4 rounds to the targets dying timer. If a dying character takes stress damage, they lose 1 round off their dying timer for each stress taken, unless being treated by another character.
If a dying target does recover at least 1 stress they are no longer dying, however they remain unconcious until they naturally heal at least 1 minor consequence, typically 1 hour.

## Combat

Swords happen. When they do it's important to know how to deal with it.
In combat or turn action each participant has a number of action points (AP) that govern what and how much they can do. AP is fully restored at the start of each combatant's turn.

### Overview

Initiative: Roll +AGI. Highest roll goes first.
Play continues in initiative order.
Each participant spends AP to take actions.

### Attack and Defense
Defending is not automatic. The first defensive action each turn costs 1 AP and the second and beyond cost 2. There is also the full defense action which costs 2 AP and allows you to defend against any number of attacks, but prevents you from attacking or casting a spell in the round and can not be used if you did attack or cast a spell.

Since only players roll, they roll for both attack and defense while NPCs have static DCs for both.

    Example: Fiora the PC is in a Duel with a champion minion an NPC. The minion spends 1 AP to attack and will hit automatically unless Fiora takes a defensive action. In this case Fiora spends 1 AP to parry and gets to roll parry against the NPC's attack score of 14. Fiora rolls a total of 16 and succeeds in parrying the attack. The NPC, frustrated, ends its turn.
    On Fiora's action she spends 1 AP to attack, which the minion attempts to block by spending an AP of its own. Fiora rolls her attack attempt against the NPC's block defense of 15 and rolls an 11. The minion is able to block her attack. Undaunted, Fiora attacks again by spending 2 AP. The minion is out of its own AP and so is unable to defend. Fiora hits automatically and rolls her weapon effort of d6+2 for 4 total damage, defeating the minion.

## Actions
Attack - 1AP* - Offensive, Focus - Make a single attack against a single target. Each attack after the first in a round costs 2AP instead of 1.
Cast a Spell - 1AP* - Magic, Focus - Spend MP to cast a spell you know or use a scroll. For most spells you may spend extra AP for additional effects.
Move - 1AP - Move - Move up to your speed. You may also take cover if cover is close at hand or engage a target if within reach of it. Movement of any distance requires this action, i.e. standing from prone or shifting over a space is a move action.
Teamwork - 1AP - Focus - Grant a single ally within arms reach 1 boon on either an  offensive or defensive roll. May only grant each ally one bonus a round, though may choose other allies for subsequent actions. Teamwork bonus stack without a cap.
Interact - 1AP* - Focus - Interact actions are a broad class of actions that encompass *doing* something during action. A common use of interact would be to use a healing potion or to attempt to pick a lock in the middle of combat. Some interact actions may take more than 1 AP. If an item, for instance, is stowed in a bag it must be found and readied before it can be used, thus that interact action may cost 2AP.
Disengage - 2AP - Focus, Move - If you are engaged with at least 1 enemy, a disengage action will allow you to move your speed away from that enemy without suffering any attacks of opportunity. If you are engaged with more than 1 enemy, you must make a dodge attempt against the highest attack rating amongst the enemies. This attempt suffers 1 bane for each enemy after the second.
Attack of Opportunity - 1AP* - Reaction, Focus - When a target engaged with you casts a spell, moves out of your reach, or takes an action against a target other than you, you may make a single attack against them. This attack suffers one bane. Each AoO after the first AoO or normal attack each round costs 2 AP instead of 1 and suffers 2 bane instead of one.
    Yes Attacks count as AoO for the purposes of increased AP cost.
Take Priority - 1 AP* - Reaction - When another target takes their turn, you may interrupt them and take your turn first. This may be used in the middle of a turn, but cannot be used to negate or invalidate an action.
Hold - 1 AP - Reaction, Focus - On your turn take this action to delay your turn until a time you choose. If you do not take your action before you next turn in initiative order, your AP is lost.
Dodge - 1AP - Defensive - Attempt to dodge an incoming attack. Roll + dodge against the attacker's attack score. Some attacks cannot be dodged. Each defensive action after the first each round costs 2AP instead of 1.
Block - 1AP - Defensive - Attempt to block an incoming attack. Roll + block against the attacker's attack score. Some attacks cannot be blocked. Each defensive action after the first each round costs 2AP instead of 1.
Parry - 1AP - Defensive - Attempt to parry an incoming attack. Roll + parry against the attacker's attack score. Some attacks cannot be parried. Each defensive action after the first each round costs 2AP instead of 1.
Full Defense - 2AP - Defensive  - If you haven't taken a focus action this round you may spend 2 AP to enter a full defense stance. Until your next turn you may defend against any number of incoming attacks. Additionally when you defend against and attack you may spend 1 AP to add 2 boon to that defense. After taking a full defense you may not take a focus action until your next turn. (focus actions include Attack, Cast a Spell, and Teamwork)


## Items and Equipment

Armor and Shields add to block defense.
    Light Armor also adds to dodge
    Heavy Armor and shields grants a Minor consequence in addition to its defense bonus
        When the consequence is used the armor is broken and no longer adds its defensive bonus

Weapons
    Some weapons have bonuses to attack or damage against certain defenses. A mail breaker dagger, for example, has 2 boons to attack verses block defenses.
    Two-Weapon fighting - At the start of each round while fighting with 2 compatable weapons you may choose either Parry or Attack. The action you choose gets a boon while the other action gets a bane.

Supply
    A score that each character has that allows them to refill their tools. By default they can only refill items they brought with them. For example if they brought torches, then thay can refill their torches, however if they forgot to bring rope, they could not spend supply on rope. Supply represents a character's forsight and preparedness without requiring the player to plot each item. There is a variation called 'omni-supply' that high Wit characters get which allows them to refill any item whether they brought it or not.

## Effort

Effort is a non-combat term for damage. Making attempts always does effort on a success. There are 4 types of effort: Simple, Weapon/tool, magic, and ultimate. Simple effort is a d4 and is the basic level of effort. Weapon/tool effort is a d6 and represents using, as the name implies, tools or a weapon. Magic effort is a d8 and used for anything magical or non-mundane uses magic effort. Ultiate effort is a d12 and reserved for the pinicle of efforts. Critical hits and some abilities do ultimate effort. Ultimate effort explodes on 12.

Challenges have a stress value in addition to their challenge value.

| Difficulty    | Challenge | Stress    |
| Easy          |   11      |   3       |
| Challenging   |   14      |   5       |
| Difficult     |   17      |   8       |
| Dasterdly     |   20      |   11      |

## Attributes
6 attributes ranked 0 to 5. Each has a bonus at +4. After +5 they grant a boon on associated attempts instead of a flat bonus.
