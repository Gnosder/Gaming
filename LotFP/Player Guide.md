## Chapter 6 — The Fugue of Arlon
	Arlon is the default world of SFS. 2000 years ago a calamitous storm blew across the face of the world and forced the resident races into seclusion. 
### History
	The current face of Arlon has been irrevocably warped by a calamitous storm referred to as the Ruination or Wrath of Yarm. The storm rendered vast stretches of the world uninhabitally corrupted by magical fallout known as Wrath or Ruin Seed. During the storm a rift opened in the center sea, now called the Malestrom. A ragged fleet of refugee humans poured out of the rift and was promptly scattered by the storm. In the face of the storm the races of Arlon retreated to safety and while they survived they have since entered into a state of decline.
	It is now 2000 years post Ruination, or 2000 FY (Year since the Fall) in the Human Calendar of New Yarm. The Dwarves, Elves, and Halflings of Arlon have fallen into a tenuous coexistence with the Humans of Yarm. Arlon itself is scarred. Monsters from before the storm and mutants created in its wake stalk the land. The remnants of the old world are steeped in Ruin and haunted by restless ghosts. 

### Arlon Geography
	Arlon has 11 large continents, 5 of which came into being in the wake of the Ruination, and countless small archeplagos dot the shallow oceans of the world. A vast Underworld descends in layers beneath the surface, much of which has been untouched for thousands of years. 
	Of the continents of Arlon the most important is Eyis where the bult of SFS takes place (or at least begins).

### Eyis
	The largest continent of Arlon 

### Wrath
    Physical corruption left behind in the wake of the Ruination. It usually manefests as red fibers that seem to grow on plants, rocks, and even animals like some strange ivy. It has a sweet sulpher smell. Wrath has a corrupting influence on living matter, those touched by wrath become paranoid and unstable until falling into violent fits of maddness. Some 'wrath touched' recover from exposure, most do not and the symptopms they develop become permanent. When enough wrath is present in an area it can "bloom" were it blossums like a flower, these wrath flowers are as valuable as they are beautiful. Wrath sometimes also solidifies into crystals.
    The value of wrath is oft debated by scholars, but alchemists can use it to create tinctures and drugs. Some individuals will pay handsomely for Wrath blooms and crystals.
