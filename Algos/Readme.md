    The capital city and in fact the setting from Blades in the Dark is here.

## The Ink Sea

## Regions, size, etc.

Only a single contenent is "known", widely known as the "Cascade", Upper, Middle, and Lower. The Cascades is split by a long mountain chain known as "the spine" with numerous other mountain chains branching off it, "the ribs". It is surrounded on all sides by ocean; the Ink Sea to the north which flows into The Barrier Sea (named such because of the ancient pylons that prevent the Ink Sea from spreading) on the west, and eventually the Sea of Giants (named after the floating and often wandering islands); to the east the Ink Sea feeds into and is slowly consuming the Tumult (a stormy, unpredictable ocean from which massive storms arise)  which wraps all the way along the Cascade's coast until it meets up with the Sea of Giants.

The Cascade is about the size of North and South America. Berin is Canada, Kevros is America and Mexico, Jurai is South America. In shape the landmass is similar, but wider at the middle than Earth (Panama is thicker and the Spine runs through it).

Upper Cascade is Berin
Middle Cascade is Cevros (Kevros)
Lower Cascade is Jurai
