## Awakening
“You wake up in darkness. Laying cramped in a small space. You’ve been buried alive! Pressing against the top of your prison, you feel the lid give way and open. You’re greeted by a cool night breeze. By moonlight you see a handful of other coffins, freshly exhumed and being opened by their own occupants. It appears you are not alone. You think back, trying to remember what led you to this spot, but your memory fails you; you don’t remember where you are or how you got there. Glancing around you, you see an ancient and decaying graveyard and, a few dozen feet from you, a flickering light emanating from a canvas tent.”

> Moonlit area. Lots of starlight streaming in from above. The tent has a small lantern hanging inside it.
> Decaying graveyard within a copse of tall, petrified trees
> The air is uncomfortably dry and hot. It smells like corpse dust.

The tent is canvas and worn, the 'bones' of the tent are bronze and have a faint aura of abjuration. Inside the tent is Warder Nek.

> Nek is a human in his late middle years. His skin is sunworn and leathered. His hair is long and unkempt, it is beginning to clump into dreadlocks. His weathered appearance belies his wisdom and strength.
(He is a Way of Shadows Monk of 4th level)

"As you peer into the tent you see a human man meditating on the ground, wisps of incense curl about him as if a living thing. The man has sunworn and leathered skin, gaunt, but hiding power. His hair is long, unkept and is beginning to clump into dreadlocks. As you regard him, his eyes slowly open. "Welcome friends. You've been asleep a long time. Please don't push yourself too hard, the night is still young and we have plenty of time yet. I am Warder Nek, and I am here to guide you as best I can."

> He starts off slowly, so as not to overwhealm and asks for introductions.
> Warder Nek received a vision from the walker and was shown the prophecy by the speaker. He knew where to dig and who he would find (Lightborn).
> He tells them he is supposed to take them to see Fan'dran'el and warns them of the dangers of the land. He knows about the colossi and the corruption.
> He is not pushy, he will let the lightborn do as they see fit. He will request to acompany them so that he might aid them. If they refuse, he will follow them discreetly.

## Out of the Woods
One way or another the lightborn will leave the copse of unmarked graves and enter into Yalt. After spending their first full day in Yalt they will gain 1 defliement.

"The land around you is desolate and scarred. Here and there stand once massive trees now petrified. Nothing living can be seen in the petrified wasteland. The air is dry, but cooler in the open than it was in the thick copse from which you came. Warder Nek smiles wearily and tells you that it wont last, the sun seems to hate Yalt and it is unbearable in the daylight."

> Daylight is hot, but the night the time of monsters.

"As you travel you see tall spires in the distance, they touch the sky delicately, but seem somehow wrong. Hollow. Warder Nek follows your gaze. 'That's the ruined Necropolis of Yalt, a cursed and evil place. We'll be staying well away from it, it wont do to get eaten by ghouls so soon after waking up.'"

> He knows most of the history of Yalt and has time for a story about its fall.

"After a while you turn away from the cursed necropolis of Yalt and wind your way through trails that only Warder Nek seems to see. Through a break in the petrified jungle you spy a towering highway of stone running over the tree tops. 'That's the Highroad of Yalt, or what's left of it. Now it's unusable and ruined. Just another reminder of this places cursed past. We'll follow the road until we see smoke. We'll find Fin'dran'el there.' You continue onward, guided by starlight and the sure step of Warder Nek, until Dawn just begins to crest the far away mountains of Hoarfrost. Against the steadily brightening light you spot small wisps of smoke curling their way into the sky. 'That is were Fin'dran'el lies. I don't know what to expect there save that. I advise caution.'"

## Fin'dran'el
"Lying in a clearing in the petrified jungle you see the skeleton of a massive bi-pedal metal construct. Clearly Fin'dran'el, or what's left of it. The colossus would have towered at least 300 feet high when it could stand. You can still see that it was lean, with the same curve and wirey frame that you would associate with an Elf. Surrounding the colossus are a collection of crude, but sturdy shelters and a dozen humanoids in the process of salvaging what is left of the great construct. The creatures are human like in every way but their eyes, which house pitch black irises and seem to weep some black sludge."

> The smoke belongs to a Currupted salvage camp. There the currupted are breaking down the remains of Fin'dran'el and sending the > salvage to places unkown. The Corrupted are hostile to all and hate Warders the most, they will recognize the Lightborn as 
> warders on sight (similar to a Paladin's divine sense; this handicap will soon fade from the lightborn). They will not fight a 
> losing battle, but will die if escape is not afforded to them. They will not speak to Warders and will die suddenly if captured. > A dead corrupted is indistingushable from a non-corrupted creature.
> Adversaries: The camp houses 11 Corrupted Labourers, 2 Guards, and 1 Taskmaster.
> Loot: Basic supplies and foodstuffs, as well as breaker kits (salvaging), there are a few handfulls of small coins amongst the 
> bodies (93cp, 17sp). A small lockbox in the taskmaster's tent also has 14gp, 3sp, and 7cp.
> Also, there is a small crate (hinted at in the taskmaster's ledger) that holds some salvage. Most of it is spell iron, but there is a single shield plate.

"The skeleton is made from some unfathomly dense metal, it's clear the corrupted had attempted to dismatle it, as they had the rest of the colossus, but were unable to dent the frame. As you examine the entirity of Fin'dran'el you notice that its head is completely untouched and -- even more shockingly -- a small bed of green moss grows beneath it, the first greenery you've seen is this blighted place. Warder Nek stands with a dark expresion on his normally calm facade. 'I never thought they would be so bold as to do this. Truely, this threat is more dire than we know. Now, you've come this far to speak to Fin'dran'el, approach his head, I can only hope that he still has what you need.'"

"As you approach the head of the fallen colossus the world seems to fall out of focus and you become aware of a presence that was not there before. A voice speaks then, not unlike that of Warder Nek's, and yet so much older. 'So falls my child, the world of Man has forgotten so much. But you can remind them.' A form appears out of the aether, tall and broad with his face obscured by a hooded robe, he carries a gnarled staff that feels as though it could connect the earth to the sky. 'You are here, now, to save this world from the corruption that threatens it. Though I cannot make you walk this path, I pray that you do. Too much has already failed, we don't have many chances left. My power is waning and I cannot help you as I would like. I can grant you these 3 gifts only. First, the knowledge to use my Colossi and the powers they keep. Second, this blessing to grant you resilence in the trials to come. And finally, this warning: The Bull of Ala Mhigo is in grave danger and should he fall your task will become even more impossible then it already is. Take care, my Lightborn. With a lot of perserverance and a bit of luck, we'll see each other again.' WIth that the image fades and the world returns to normal. Warder Nek is standing behind you, still looking sadly at the fallen colossus. Without looking away he asks you, 'What did you see?'"

After talking with Warder Nek and setting a plan for what comes next. Warder Nek suggests they camp in a shady spot and wait out the daylight. He suggests they head to Alexander and the Warder Circle there. He will introduce them to the Speaker who will help them find/access the 'Bull of Ala Mhigo'.

It grants +1 AC and can be used once to fully negate a hit, this destroys the plate and damages the rune. The rune itself may be removed and added to armor or a shield which gives it a magic +1 bonus. Only Lightborn may use runes.
