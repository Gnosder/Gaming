# Creystal Shore

A large coastal region that leads to the far lands and the Silverd Seas beyond them

## The Far Lands

Landmark; Colossus; Defiled

A grouping of islands far off the coast of the shore where Eli'qui'el lives. The colossus is a sea creature (an octopus) and lives far beneath the surface (600m). It is corrupted but dormant.

## Port Doma (Shyshore)

Holdfast

The primary home of House Doma and the center of their merchant empire. Most of their influence is elsewhere, though they have eyes on the High Seat. They are rumored to have ties to the Black Sea Pirates, though it's unproven.

## The Spawning Grounds
