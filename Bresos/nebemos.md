# Nebemos

A region of moving sand dunes and craggy expanses.  Oasis and areas of scrub are mixed throughout.

## Regional and Main conflicts

### Main Conflict

Pippin has been captured and is being corrupted. He is being held at camp Fellpoint.

### Regional Conflict

The great Serpent has destroyed Nebos and threatens the surivors. It needs to be stopped. One of the survivors was a priest of the serpent and has access to a temple where it can be lured.

## The Nebian encampment and Fallen Nebos

Holdfast

Nebos was a great city, riveling the largest districts of Alexander until the Great Serpent was corrupted. It attacked and destroyed Nebos as well as the many settlements along the banks of the Amul (which flows from hoarfrost into Yalt and from there into the sea). The serpent ravaged the Amul and caused flooding which runined any settlement it missed. Now, however, the Amul's water level has dropped drastically (the flow out of Hoarfrost stopped recently) and threatens to destroy what few Nebians remain.

The encampment was built in a section of Nebos that the serpent couldn't reach (the wards bar its entry) and house the survivors of Nebos. Many have tried to flee to Alexander, taking up residence outside the walls of New Mhigo. However a new edict from the High Seat is preventing more refugees from leaving Nebemos for the city. A battalion of Alexandrian Soldier has been stationed in the Encampment to maintain order and help them rebuild--if the serpent is ever dealt with (THe High Seat wants the serpent put down)

## The Ruined Riverside

Landmark

What's left of the settlement of Yslamul. It has been consumed by the flooding of the Amul and great mounds mark the coming of the serpent.

## The Deep Oasis

Dungeon

## Sam Amul

Landmark

This settlement was destroyed by the serpent and has not be consumed by the  river or sands... yet.

## The Mouth of Yuul

Dungeon; deflied

A tunnel the serpent once rested in. It has been taken over by the corrupted who defiled the colossus. The many chambered tunnel holds their base in the region.

## The Monument of Rogarth

Landmark

All that remains of an ancient city that once worshiped the serpent and fell to time. 'Ozymandius'

## Camp Fell Point

Landmark; defiled

Pippin Mhigo set up this camp to observe corrupted in the area. He thought it was secure, but he was discovered in the night and captured. The cultists are trying to corrupted him and have taken over the camp.

## Hidden Temple of Rogarth

Dungeon

A buried temple that houses treasures of Rogarth and has not been devled into. At the surface has an altar that can be used to subdue the colossus. The dungeon gets damaged if the colossus is battled at the temple.

## Fresh Spring Oasis

Landmark

A common stop between Alexander and Nebos. This oasis is fed by an underground spring that has thus far not been disrupted by the serpent. The hard rock crags around the area prevent the serpent from moving freely around the oasis. A small group of Nebians are living here, helping keep supply lines open for the encampment.

## Wandering Landmarks

### The Great Serpent of Rogarth

Colossus

This colossi has been corrupted and wanders the sands (ala Sand Worm). It attacks and devours anything that attracts its attention. It cannot approach the Holdfast due to the ancient wards around the encampment.

## Cool Scenes and Events

### The Great Serpent comes

When the Lightborn enter Nebemos for the first time, the serpent should make istelf known. Breaching up out of the sands to devour something. Like a military cart from Alexander that had supplies for the camp. Soldiers running and screaming. Ground quakes marking the coming of the colossus. A massive spray of sand and earth as it breachs the ground beneath a stuck wagon. When the serpent leaves the area it leaves behind (i.e. abandons) a number of servitors that haunt the area until their power fails them and they disolve into the aether that spawned them.

## Random Encounters

## The Bull of Mihgo (Main Quest)

The Bull of Mihgo, Pippin, was on a scouting mission to asertain what had happened to the Great Serpent. He was captured by corrupted who took them back to their camp and are attempting to corrupt him, but he is stronger than they expected.

### Camp Fellpoint

This small camp is currently home to a dozen corrupted Nebians. They were corrupted when Nebos fell and are capturing survivors and taking them to a corrupted heart in the camp for conversion. Pippin is there now and is mostly corrupted, he will fall if left for too much longer.

## The Great Serpent (Region Quest)

The serpent was corrupted long ago, but only recently awakened. It has destroyed Nebos as well as most of the settlements in Nebemos. It is rampaging around the region, weakening the ward it was protecting.

### Getting to the Serpent

There are 2 main ways to get access to the colossus: 1) Track it through the desert and force it to the surface, 2) Summon it to the temple of Rogarth and bind it there.

### Cleansing the Serpent

To remove the corruption, its corrupted heart must be destroyed. This is easier said than done.

### Flighting the Colossus

Goal: Destroy the corrupted heart

The serpent: 400 ft long and 50ft wide. It moves through the loose sand freely and doesn't stay still. If it has been bound in the Temple it rages and tries to destroy the fetters. Its goal is to escape it's fetters and/or destroy the Desert Ward (this will kill the serpent). It doesn't directly attack people unless they prove themselves a threat. The corrupted heart is on the 'back' of the colossus(more tumor than heart).

The Temple: A small, ruined temple about 20'x 30' in a large craggy valley. The area shows signs of extreme damage (the colossus used to live/sleep here) and is mostly open. The temple is surrounded (at a range of 500') by 7 pillars which were used to subdue the colossus in the past. They're simple to use, though their power source has been corrupted (it can be cleanse by the lightborn fairly easily)

Fighting the Serpent: Not an easy task to battle a colossus. To do so one has to climb on top and attack the heart and/or expose the heart by activating the altar in the temple at the right time. There are also a number of corrupted servitors (constructs created by the serpent to assist it) that will defend the colossus.

The Altar: When the serpent is above ground the altar can be activaed (so long as the cage is up) to bind the colossus in place for 2 rounds. Only a lightborn can use the altar, While the altar is active the colossus is stunned.

The cage: When the cage is active, the colossus cannot escape it. The beast will attack the pylons every frew rounds. Two hits destroys one and if 4 are destroyed the cage fails.

When the colossus burrows, jump off or save vs breach. It burrows every 5 or 6 rounds and breaches the round after that. WHen the colossus is above ground it 'compesses' and is only 20ish feet above ground.
To climb on the colossus is a DC12 athletics, it takes 20ft of movement to get to the heart.

HP 90 AC 10
Movement: 0

Special:
The heart is immune to ranged attacks unless the altar has been used and the colossus is stunned.
