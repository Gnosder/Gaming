# Nebemos

A region of moving sand dunes and craggy expanses.  Oasis and areas of scrub are mixed throughout.

## The Nebian encampment and Fallen Nebos

Holdfast

Nebos was a great city, riveling the largest districts of Alexander until the Great Serpent was corrupted. It attacked and destroyed Nebos as well as the many settlements along the banks of the Amul (which flows from hoarfrost into Yalt and from there into the sea). The serpent ravaged the Amul and caused flooding which runined any settlement it missed. Now, however, the Amul's water level has dropped drastically (the flow out of Hoarfrost stopped recently) and threatens to destroy what few Nebians remain.

The encampment was built in a section of Nebos that the serpent couldn't reach (the wards bar its entry) and house the survivors of Nebos. Many have tried to flee to Alexander, taking up residence outside the walls of New Mhigo. However a new edict from the High Seat is preventing more refugees from leaving Nebemos for the city. A battalion of Alexandrian Soldier has been stationed in the Encampment to maintain order and help them rebuild--if the serpent is ever dealt with (THe High Seat wants the serpent put down)

Colossus

This colossi has been corrupted and wanders the sands (ala Sand Worm). It attacks and devours anything that attracts its attention. It cannot approach the Holdfast due to the ancient wards around the encampment.

## Cool Scenes and Events

### The Great Serpent comes

When the Lightborn enter Nebemos for the first time, the serpent should make istelf known. Breaching up out of the sands to devour something. Like a military cart from Alexander that had supplies for the camp. Soldiers running and screaming. Ground quakes marking the coming of the colossus. A massive spray of sand and earth as it breachs the ground beneath a stuck wagon.
