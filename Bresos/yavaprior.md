# The Verdant Expanse of Yavaprior

Colossus White Stag

## Alderel

Elven Holdfrast

An elvish colony, only a few dozen elves live there. They know about and support Warders, though they don't offer any overt help. Their leader Matron Gleandel knows far more than she will ever let on. She was there when Walker made the colossi and knows what they guard. She is the final failsafe and as such wont take any risks. Essentially if the colossi fall, she can overload Alexander and destroy the island, hopefully killing  Cthaat in the process (he is presumably in a weakened state). Gleandel will do nothing to draw the corruption the her though will do everything she can to repell it should if find them. "We all have are parts to play, and while I have mine, I hope it never comes to pass."

The Elves offer artesan goods and can create up to very rare magic items. The items they make are made of silver and oak and confer +1 to hit or can remove disadvantage to stealth from certain armors (not full plate).

## The Glade of the White Stag

Colossus, Defiled

The smallest of the colossus (size: huge) the stag is grown from white oak and lives mostly within its glade. There is a chance its not there, but usually is. Its powers give it the ability to control and grow plants. It is inactive and corrupted. Its glade is withering and becoming toxic. Elvish handlers are attempting to reverse the corruption, but the Stag's Moss Agate has been stolen and without it they don't have enough power to do so. The trail leads to a corrupted logging camp on the edge of the forest.

## Corrupted Logging Camp

Landmark

The corrupted here are harvesting wood for their war effort. The group that stole the Moss Agate from the White Stag were heading back here but were ambushed by plants near the Tangle. Only one survivor made it back. He wont say anything and will die like the rest if captured, but there are enough clues in the camp to lead to Aloth's Lair.

## The Tangle (Aloth's Lair)

Dungeon

This large tangle of overgrown foliage hides a vast underground cave system. The Green Dragon Aloth lairs there, he has been sleeping for the past hundred years and has no idea the corruption has returned. He allows a number of ambulatory plants to live as guards around his home. The Moss Agate was taken by a trent who lives in one of the upper caves.
