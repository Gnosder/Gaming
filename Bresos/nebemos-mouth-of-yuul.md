# The Mouth of Yuul

A massive rift in the ground. Once the resting place of the Serpant of Rogarth and now a headquarters of sorts for the corrupted.

## The layout

The main tunnel is a massive affair, easily 60feet wide and declines at a steady grade. It opens up into a huge underground cavern, 90ft tall and close to 1000ft wide; it is a rough oval.

A wood and stone fort is constructed within the cavern at the point where the serpent's head once rested. This fort is manned by corrupted, cultists of the great serpent. Their leader is working to corrupted pippin, the restare milling about.

There are also a few side chambers off the main tunnel, these have had multiple uses throughout the years, mostly by desert predetors (some may still be there).

## First Visit

Pippin is being held on the top floor of the central tower, a massive amount of corruption aspected magic marks the ritual site. The tower is protected and patroled by 2 dozen corrupted soldiers and warlocks.

## Room by Room

### The entrance and main tunnel

From the massive entrance the tunnel winds back several hundred feet. Cracks and caverns dot the walls, most lead to nothing. A strong scent of cinnimon comes from one of the cracks, a honey'd ambusher lives here.

### The Corrupted Fort

7 Corrupted Cultists
3 corrupted shamans
2 corrupted warlocks
5 corrupted servators

### The Nest

The majority of the main cavern is taken up by an area known as the Nest. It is here that the serpent slept. Ancient nodes litter the ground, the serpant used them to recharge (the energy source is corrupted, this is what corrupted the serpent)

#### The Flow

A 'river' below the cavern full of earth and fire aspected aether that has been corrupted. Leads to a cistern at the Temple of Rogarth and was used by the serpent to recharge, corrupted.
