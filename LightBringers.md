I want to make a new game that is simple and flexible. I want gameplay to be cinematic and for character flavor to be clear on the character sheet.

Name the game Horizon: Infinite Expanse or Horizon: Aeons Ascendant or Horizon Ascendant: Aeons

Choose: Power Source (Martial, Arcane, Divine, Necromancy, etc.)
Choose: Role (Defender, Blaster, Controller, etc.)

Similar to numenera: I am a [Power Source] [Role] who seeks [Goal]
    "I am an arcane defender who seeks to the end of the lich king"

Should have a virute and vice
Maybe a high concept and a trouble.

Should be able to push your luck (rerolling should have a downside; double or nothing).

Stress tracks (Physical, Mental, Magical) (+social?)

Fate uses Concepts, Skills, and Stress. Add Stunts, Consequences, and Inventory.

I like combat to follow a 1-2 format. Characters set-up and then execute. Let the set-ups be a manuever and the executes be an attack. 
    Establish turn order. Slowest set-up first. Fastest execute first.
    You can take an abort action only if you haven't taken an action yet.

Use magnets. A metal board with a sheet on it and magnetic "pins" to represent where things are. I have a bunch of magnets...

Aspects
    Each character will have:
        A High Concept.
        A trouble or a vice.
        3 Character Aspects
        They gain 1 extra active aspect every 4 levels.
    As characters grow they gain more aspects and some can change.  This list is important. We call them scars. Any inavtive aspect is a scar. During downtime a character can trade out any of their active aspects for a scar.

When making a new character:
    Your first aspect is a high concept which should follow the format of "I am a(n) [power source] [role] of the [culture/order].
    Your second aspect is a trouble or vice; [trouble] complicates my life.
    For a new character your 3-5th aspects follow a format:
        3. Where did you come from? (background)
        4. What made you who you are? (Rising Conflict)
        5. What was your first "adventure"?

Skills
    Use fate pyramid. Start with 30 points (2 great, 3 good, 4 fair, 5 average for a total of 14 skills).
    As level increases gain more skill slots.

Fate
    Both your ability to manipulate the world and how many ability points you have. Your refresh is half your max.
    Fate increases with level.

Stress
    3 tracks Physical, Magical, Social

    Stress tracks start at 5 + Skill

Consequences
    Mild, Moderate, Severe
    Armor can add others in addition to reducing physical stress

Victories / Defeats
    Track victories and defeats. Both translate into EXP. Victories help the PCs and defeats help the GM.
    Defeat == Succeed at a cost. Or failed to push their luck.
    Able to reroll ANY action once, but if they fail the GM adds 1 defeat.

What's the theme?
    Heroic cinematic Good guys fighting evil
