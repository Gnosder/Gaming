# Herald's of Gaxton

This is season 2 of the Wrath of Gaxton campaign and is set 10 years after the defeat of Sephirot. It is set on the World of Algos Alpha in Eastern Berin, a regin of the Cascades. Season 2 also marks a change from the Dusk Bastards system to the Pathfinder 2e Remaster system.

## Gaxton After the Coils

When Sephirot was banished the bubble around Gaxton faded, but so too did the Wrath. King Gundolf Hightower and Queen Esmiralda Rosegauld have tasked the Agency with exploration outside of Gaxton. Lord Mot Le'Crue was granted peerage over Haversfjord on the condition that the settlement be used as a launching point into the the greater Berin area.

## Threads Post Coils

### Shadows over Mach

The Void-sent Diablos is looking for the Void Ark to begin his plans in the region.

### Allagns in the Sky

Aziz Lla, the ancient Allagan airship is still silently mored high above Berin. What secrets does it still hold?

### The Hollowed Bastion

With the defeat of the Hive the mutants of the Hollowed Bastion have been granted a reprieve. However it was short lived as Void-sent began attacking them from the east.

### In Roads to a New World

The Aldan Dominion of Kevros has been looking for a safe route into norther Berin, but the Wrath was blocking that. (East of the Spine is buffeted by High Storms and the Ink Sea has its own dangers). They have landed near the ruins of Limsa and are making cautious inroads deeper into the area.

### Legacy of Zratcha

Little is known of the once powerful Island chain, but more is being discovered each year.
