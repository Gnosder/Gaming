    Ser Deadric asked the Heroes to find a missing expedition sent out to a boat launch to the north.
    Discovered "Miles Warde" wounded survivor of the expediton. Learned that Ser Gorste had gone crazy and dragged the rest of the expidition into a cistern.

    Traveled into a cistern. Hot jungle near a zigguraut. Attacked by wrath-touched apes and then by wrath golems. Session ended knowing a ritual was being performed above.

    Picked up in ziggurat. Went to top level and battled the corrupted Ser Gorste. Defeated him and retrieved the wrath heart before having to escape. There were no other survivors.

    Lore: A basic teleportation network is up and running. Major nodes exist at Haversfjord, Gaxton, Azis Lla, and the Frayed Mountain. Sub nodes exist at all the above. The heroes are attuned to all major nodes and all sub nodes except azis lla.
    Rewards: The heroes will be given some items found in the mage's guild's archives. They were innert until recently. Shifting Rune (220gp), Emerald Grasshopper Talisman (25gp), Iron Cube Talisman (50gp). As well as formula for each. Other items are being found and will be made available for purchase and given as payment for services from the guild/agency.
    Plan: The Heroes will be asked to protect a large caravan going to the mountain. The path is mostly wrath free, but the wildlife is suffering 'withdrawls' and are hyper aggressive.

Parlay

The dominion claims the land of Berin as soverign. Submit and live, resist and be destroyed. The Dominion laid claims to western berrin long ago, but was unable to claim it due to the wrath. Other nations don't care, because of the wrath. Now that the wrath has faded the dominion is attempting to exert their claims. The Dominion is Imperial Rome, it's capital is Dominius. The site they are at now is being called Castrum Berin Primus. The mutants outnumber them 2:1.

House of Changes Ketch missing. 
    Geth, Vex, other races. (House of Devils has a rouge member Ketch House of Darkness).

The Archon Splicer Misraaks' (Mithrax) Ketch has gone missing in a frontier system. Clues point to an old Vex conflux on the planet Skolas III. A Geth scout ship is investigating as well and is found in the area, they shoot on sight. The Vex conflux leads into a vex structure of unknown origin and use. Misraaks opens the way, though that is unkown to the others.

Vex vs Geth

Vex architecture is full of hard light, floating 'data' grams that make it look like artefacting in VR. It uses a lot of cubes and triangles. It rarely looks "finished" and more like "good enough" but it is sturdy and difficult to destroy.
Geth architecture on the other hand is organic and flowing. Cables and struts are rarly exposed. Geth prefer minimalism to the grand mega structures of the Vex.
