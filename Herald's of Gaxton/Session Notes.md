    10 Years after time jump.
    Ser Deadric asked the Heroes to find a missing expedition sent out to a boat launch to the north.
    Discovered "Miles Warde" wounded survivor of the expediton. Learned that Ser Gorste had gone crazy and dragged the rest of the expidition into a cistern.

    Traveled into a cistern. Hot jungle near a zigguraut. Attacked by wrath-touched apes and then by wrath golems. Session ended knowing a ritual was being performed above.

    Loot:   Gorilla Encounter 60xp
            Scythe Tree Encounter 80xp

    Picked up in ziggurat. Went to top level and battled the corrupted Ser Gorste. Defeated him and retrieved the wrath heart before having to escape. There were no other survivors.

    Took Miles back to Haversfjord and debreiffed with Daedric.

            Ser Gorste Encounter 120xp

    Lore: A basic teleportation network is up and running. Major nodes exist at Haversfjord, Gaxton, Azis Lla, and the Frayed Mountain. Sub nodes exist at all the above. The heroes are attuned to all major nodes and all sub nodes except azis lla.
    Rewards: The heroes will be given some items found in the mage's guild's archives. They were innert until recently. Shifting Rune (220gp), Emerald Grasshopper Talisman (25gp), Iron Cube Talisman (50gp). As well as formula for each. Other items are being found and will be made available for purchase and given as payment for services from the guild/agency.
    Plan: The Heroes will be asked to protect a large caravan going to the mountain. The path is mostly wrath free, but the wildlife is suffering 'withdrawls' and are hyper aggressive.
