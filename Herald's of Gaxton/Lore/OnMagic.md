# On Magic

# Understanding Magic by Charles Del La Rocha of Gaxton

Until recently the magic that was known to the citizens of Gaxton was simple. Arcane lights, the summoning of simple familiars, basic telekinetic effects that could be acheived just as well with physical effort. However, the Banishment of the great Eikon Sephirot by Lord Le'Crux and his companions ushered in an elemental shift in our understanding of magic. As the hateful Wrath faded away mages at the Gaxton School of Magery began experiencing a Euphoria when channeling magic that we have begun to call Mana Burn. In addition simple spells grew in power and even the most advanced magics of the college became easier for others to learn. It was as if the hateful Wrath had been surpressing magic and with its disuliton the concentration of magic in the kingdom grew greatly.

In the year 1190 AG Lord Mot Le'Crux, who we now know had been beyond the Shield of Gaxton and had traveled in the be Wrathed world of before, arrived at the college. Lord Le'Crux was unknown to all, having come seemingly out of nowhere only months before, however his magical prowess was unlike any we had ever seen. His acumen and, yes, his pride was stunning to witness. Given the task of remaining dry, without moving, while water is thrown at him -- a task that I myself was deeply confounded by for many years -- Lord Le'Crux summoned a massive spectral hand to shield him from the water! Such a feat was no doubt superfluous, as blocking a simple stream of water without such spectical was likely well within his abilities. However it was the first time we, the mages of the college, had born witness to magics beyond our own. This, of course, was not the last time Lord Le'Crux would surprise and shame us with how little we knew. On one ocasion he brought the Great Dragon Tiamat to Gaxton as casually as one might stroll down the street!

Still, anticts aside, he showed us there was much we didn't know and much still to learn. A grand revelation for scholars such as myself. In the wake of Foul Sephirot's banishment from our world the College sparred no moment in our study of magic. This time was met with rapid advancements in the study of magic. Where once we had thought that only a privalged few could learn magic, we learned that anyone could learn to weild it. Where once we had thought that the 'mana' we used came from the heart of Hightower, we now understood that we had been drawing solely from our own souls. Souls that had never before been exposed to the ambiant magics of existance and as such were weak, though fully willing.

With the hateful Wrath gone and Gaxton once again part of the larger world and with the assisstance of 2 Great Dragons (Lord Ghaul and his brood sister Queen Tiamat), the Eldest Seedseer of Gridania Lady Kan-e-Senna, and now the Vizier's of the Domion we have come to understand magic in a much brighter light.

## The Nature of Magic

Magic is created by life. This is a simple and fundamental truth. Where life exists, so too does magic.

Life and Death are the same phenominom. Both feed magic and the balance between them is greater than either alone.

There is a limit to the amount of magic a mortal can wield. While the limit can be increased, it does so slowly or at great risk to the soul of the caster.

Magic exists in harmony with the natural laws of reality and does not, as many in Gaxton has speculated before (myself included), act against them.

Thus the understanding of reality and its laws, of mathmatics and engineering as well as the physical sciences, are inextricably linked to the study of magic.

Our great axiom "Knowledge is Power" is even more true, litterally so, than we knew.

These are only some of the many fundamental truths revealed to us after Foul Sephirot's fall. Many more are yet to be discovered, I'm sure, but as out knowledge continues to grow in great leaps we will soon stand with the other magi of Agalia having been lifted to their level. 

Thus it is important to focus on the here and now. To focus on what we are currently doing.

## Vancian Magic

We have begun to refer to the current great theory of magic as 'Vancian', in the tradition of the Ur-Bearers as related to us by Vizier Olympio Nelius of Domina. This theory, honed and shaped by centuries of magi, states the following:

- Magic is greater than any who hope to control it.

- Misuse of magic has dire and often deadly consequences.

- Thus the wise magi is careful (boardering on paranoid) about the magics they cast.

We have codified the process by which we study, prepare, and cast magics to reflect these tenants. Some of the most important are as follows: 
- A magi does not cast spells they have not fully prepared. This often means both memorizing the spell and storing the energy required to cast it long before it is used, often at the same time each day (Dawn is regularly used). 
- Holding magical energies for too long risks damage to the soul and so it should be released regularly (As a guiding rule a Magi should refresh their magical energies daily). 
- There is a limit to the amount of energies a magi can use in a single cycle (this is often a standard Agalian day, though it can vary) and so a magi should only prepare spells up to their own limits. Bypassing this limit risks an unplanned release of stored magical energies (self-detonation is the oft observed sideeffect).

As a magi grows in understanding the number of discreet spells they can prepare and the power of those spells increases. It is only natural for magi to push their limits and as such it is important to remember that while these limits are not hard universal laws they have been put in place to preserve the lives of the magi and those near them.

In the creation of these rules, which all at the college follow, we have learned that more is possible. A magi can spontaneously draw, shape, and release spells on an 'ad hoc' basis. A magi can draw more power than is needed to 'overcharge' their spells. A magi can cast spells too great for them. All this and more is possible. However, simply because we know it can be done does not mean we encourage it. The terms we use to describe the negative consequences of this misuses of magic are: Mana Burn, Soul Burn, and Existance Fracture.

## The Misuse of Magic

Mana burn releates to a euphoric release of chemicals inside a magi when they push their limits. This euphoria has been likened to drunkeness or the effects of Stickweed, an almost drug like and numbing sensation. We believe it is a natural way to insulate against the more dangerous effects. While concerning, Mana Burn is not dangerous on its own, however it hearlds much more damaging conditions.

Soul Burn is not a figurative name. A magi who pushes too far past their limits will sear their very soul with the magical energies they are attempting to control. The pain of Soul Burn is (I'm told, I have not experienced it myself) greater than any other pain in life. As though your whole being is on fire. The pain of soul burn cuts through all known medicines and treatments, even the adherants of Lady Grinhilda the Merciful have failed to abate it. Beyond unimaginable pain a soul that has been so burned sees sharply diminished capacity for controlling magic until it heals, a process that can takes weeks.

Existance Fracture is the final stage of the consquences to the misuse of magic and also the final mistake a magi can make. Existance Fracture is always fatal. But death is the least of its effects. Notes taken by Magus Solens Achimonde speak of how the magi's soul itself is consumed. Nothing remains. There can be no afterlife, no possible rebirth here or elsewhere for a magi broken in such a way. To suffer Existance Fracture is to End.

As to using magic risks these dangers the current thinking is that the soul is required to hold magical energies and that pushing past the limits of the souls damages it. While we know that souls can be healed, the fact that they can also be damaged implies that they can be destroyed. This is what Existance Fracture is. The destruction of the soul.

## The Soul

In modern magic thought the existance of the soul is taken for granted. It is known the soul exists. It is a copy of a person, born from that person (not given or created by a divinity) as they grow. It interacts with magic the same as our physical bodies interact with the physical world. But the use of a soul beyond that and where it goes when it's host body dies is a subject much debated by philosophers and priests alike with no consensuse given.

For the purposes of the magi a Soul is a magical battery. We infuse it with power drawn from the world around us and then release that power when we cast our spells. To draw too much power risks damaging the battery.

## What is a Spell?

Something else oft taken for understood is the idea of a "spell". A spell is a discreet magical effect. It has power, intent, and direction (The last two often being called the Imago or image of the spell). However the spells we dicuss and that most magi use are spells that have been researched, polished, and codified for others to use. These spells have set power levels, set effects, and even the mnumonics used to cast the spell have been set. This allows all magi to use magic and to speak of it in similar terms. An endless variety of other spells exist beyond what has been recorded in the known magical writings, however care must be taken when using unknown and untested magics. To put simply the spells we have recorded are known to be 'safe', if you stray beyond that you take your saftey into your own hands.

What happens if a magi attempts a new spell and misjudges it's creation? If they supplied the spell too little power, then the spell will fail, the power will be spent, but there will be no other effect (probably). If they supplied the spell to much power, the extra power must go somewhere, thus the spell will either be supercharged or some other effect (up to and including Existance Fracture) is possible. If the magi misjudges the spell itself (the Imago) the power they reserved for the spell will likely be explosivly released.

## Divine Magic

While the Magi College of Gaxton follows what is known as the Arcane tradition other sources and uses of magic are known. The best known of these other traditions is taught at the Haversfjord Hospital by Lady Grinhilda, a tradition we call "Divine". To the best of our knowledge they do not study, prepare, or cast magic as we do. Instead we understand it as 'wish' or 'prayer' magic. It is similiar to how we cast spells before Foul Sephirot was destroyed, but still seems in line with our modern understanding. An adherant through Will or Faith shapes the ambiant magics to match a known or desired effect. They are still limited in the same way we are with how much magic they can use in a cycle. Though they are also limited in other ways. While an arcane magi can cast any spell they understand a divine magi can cast only magics they 'believe' in (which is to say magics in line with their own feelings and beliefs). The divine magi of the Haversfjord Hospital also seem to have an affinity for healing, being able to draw more power and more often in the service of such an act. 

Vizier Nelius tells stories of Animal Shapers and Wood Druids that also fit out understanding of divine magic, but little is known about them. It is likely that other traditions exists beyond what is known now.

Despite the chosen nomenclature for this traditon, it is not known whether a divinity is behind it. In fact, since the reveal of the true purpose of Mount Hightower threw our own religious beliefs into tumult and my own distance from the teachings it would not be right for me to sepculate on this tradition's true nature.

## Technology

In the frayed mountain Lord Ghaul's trusted knight and steward, an Eliksni known as Corvx, works his own type of magic which the dwarf Yerhu Rivombo calls "technology". As near as we can tell this technology is different from traditional magics and yet it still bears more than a passing resemblance. I suspect that technology and magic are two branches from the same trunk and are connected in ways as yet unknown.


# Misc

An exploration of what magic is, is not, and how it works.

Simply put, magic is created by the process of entropy, the greater the entropy of a system the greater the magic. Thus magic is most powerful around life and other powerful sources of entropy (like stars). Thus magic is created by the process of 'being'; it is because we are.

Magic has a gravity or attraction. It pools together. Large concentrations of magic can become self aware. Sometimes when things exist hard enough, they come to life and exist more.

Magic can also be aspected. It takes qualities of that which created it. Thus magic born in a fire are fire aspected. Magic born from intense negative emotions share qualities with those emotions. There is no limit to what aspects magic can have, but there are some that are more common than others. Elemental aspects, for example, are very common and naturally accuring.

Magic exists within the paradigm of Reality. It exists with, not against, the laws of physics. However magic allows for physical interactions that are not possible without it.

Every culture has some understanding of magic and each have different traditions around it. The 2 most common traditions are Technology (Electro-magery) and the Ars Mysterium (Vancian).

Technology is a form of magic. The art of conducting electrical charges along specially prepared pathways is quite similar to the conduction of magical energies across runes. There are, however, differences. Technology is often see as an equalizer. Anyone can use it, even if not everyone understands it. A rifle, for example, if one has the weapon itself and the munitions for it, they can use it. This is true even though a great deal of engineering goes into its design and creation. Technology is also useable by those who cannot otherwise use magic. Technology usually employs the 'base' or 'surface' elements (electricity being the most common).

Magic is a form of technology. The primary difference is that magic must be conducted, at least in part, by the caster. When using a computer, the user does not have to supply their own electicity to power it, this is not true for magic.

To understand this further it must be understood how magic is used. To cast a spell the following are required: A power source, an Imago (understood to be the instructions for the spell), an emitter, and the medium through which all is transmitted. With a computer this is: A battery or power i/0, a CPU, an output, the base chipset(mother board, etc.). For a magical spell this is: The caster's soul (supplies power), the caster's mind (to provide shape), the caster's Will (to complete and release the spell), and the caster themselfe (to serve as the medium for the spell). Thus technology is simply the process replacing the internal needs of a spell with external mechanisms.

A sufficiently powerful mage is vastly supereor to any technophile, however while technology can be used by anyone magic requires extensive training.
