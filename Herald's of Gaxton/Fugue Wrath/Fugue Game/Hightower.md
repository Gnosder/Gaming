# Hightower

A campaign by Gnosder. Based on Hightower Fugue.

# Summary

In the first age a powerul diety was imprisioned in a moon. In the Second Age it sumbered. In the Third Age it corrupted a powerful wizard who summoned the moon to crash into the world. The moon was destroyed before impact, but the prison survived and the diety raged. Its rage spread into the world, corrupting and twisting those of weak will. Now it is the Forth age and a thriving kingdom has grown around the remains of the moon and the prison inside. The kingdom is protected from the diety's wrath by the same prison that binds it, but still the diety rages trying to break free. Now the gears turn once more heroes rise, unware of the danger as the great Sephirot rages to escape its bonds.

Characters begin in an idyllic kingdom living in an unknown bubble protected from the corrupting Wrath outside its borders. But a chance encounter with a desperate lord sees them with the keys to explore the strange and dangerous world outside the kingdom. Wonder quickly fades to horror as they learn the Wrath holds many dangerous secrets and their home kingdom may hold the most dangerous of all.

The act ends with the heroes gaining the ability to delve into the wrath.

Act 2 - Into the Wrath

This act begins when th heroes enter the wrath (or, rather leave the saftey of Gaxton).
The Act ends when they enter the Frayed Mountain and meet with Ghaul.

Act 3 - Secrets of Gaxton

This act begins when the heroes return to gaxton to uncover the secrets of the Bubble.

This act ends when they learn about the Coils and the keys needed to open them.

Act 4 - Hubris of Mach

This act begins when the heroes begin searching for a key to open the coils.

There are several paths through this act and 3 keys that can open the coils, though only one is needed. The direct and "canonical" path is through the Hive of Hashlad√ªn, however a key can be gained by defeating Diablos in Dun Scaith. A final key can be found in the floating laboratories of Azis Lla however getting past its sheilds requires key of its own.

Act 4b -- The Shadow King

Long ago a great war, known as the War of the Magi, saw 3 great civiliazations battle against each other. The void mages of Mach destroyed the Kingdom of Nym, but when they tried to do the same to Amdapor the White Mages of Amdapor trapped their servent deep in their city. Now, many years later, heroes decend into the ruined keep of Amdapor to find an ancient key that can open the Coils of Hightower unaware of the dangers within.

This is perhaps the longest of the 3 arcs in the game. Diablos, the Voidsent that was tasked with the destruction of Amdapor has sinister plans to enact now that the Voidmages of Mach are no more and he has little interest in the unwitting heroes that set him free. He will lead them on a chase through several set peice locations of ancient Mach. From their now derilict Ark, to the streets of their ruined capital, and finally to the hidden tower guarding their most powerful magic.

Prominent Characters in this story are:
    Diablos: The primary antagonist
    Scathach: The Shadow Queen, an evil voidsent.
    Cait Sith: An animated doll created as a familiar to one of Mach's most acomplished mages.
    Leofard: A mutant treasure hunter that is tracking an ancient Ghost Ship that sails high above the Wrath.
    Radlia: A mutant treasure hunter and rival to Leofard.

Keep of Amdapor
    Simple short dunegon. Ends with Diablos breaking free and fleeing with the Alagan key (that was repurposed by Mach as a sort of skeleton key).
    Amdapor was once a grand kingdom, but is now a collection of barely standing ruins. The magic that helped create the structures has been drained by the wards holding Diablos. The heroes explore the area and find a path into the only structure still standing, the Grand Keep of Amdapor. They are forced to contend with Wrath Infused flora and the Amdaporian guardian protecting Diablos' Prison. After defeating the guardian Diablos breaks free, reanimating the guardian with void magic and fleeing with the key.

    Site 1 - the Ruins of Amdapor
    Once a city, now a swamp. Even finding the city is no easy feat as it is hidden by the Elementals of the Twelveswood. However with the blessing of Kan-E-Senna the heroes are able to penetrate the protective glamor and find the city.
    Hazards - Wrath Touched plants Ochu (4) and Morbol (6)
    A large area, but dominated by a central tower. The ruins shows evidence of disipation as the magic that built them is being consumed. Wrath touched plants cluster around a hole in the tower, feeding on the magical energy that leaks out. 

    Site 2 - Into the Keep
    Hazards - Voidsent (Ooze, Gargoyle)
        Boss - Ferdiad
    In the entryway of the Keep, before the sanctum, the Voidsent Ferdiad is attempting to corrupt the guardian. He summons 2 waves of voidsent before entering battle himself. He does not allow himself to be killed, instead he allows the heroes to think him dead and the wards on the sanctum broken.

    Site 3 - The Sanctum of the White
    Boss - Guardian
    The guardian rises to defend the Sanctum against intruders. Ferdiad weakened him, but was not willing to engage him fully. When the guardian is defeated the wards fully break and Diablos is released who empowers the fallen guardian, reviving it to buy him time to escape.
    Though Diablos escaped with the Key, the Sanctum still holds many treasures of great value. Total Value around 8k each character.
    Loot: 6k

The Void Ark
    Diablos entered the Void Ark and began to free the imprissoned Voidsent to weaken the wards and open the way to Scathach.
    The Void Compass points towards the Void Ark. So too does Leofard who is hunting the void ark. If the Heroes take the easy path through the Eastern Tower they meet Leofard who is planning an expidition to find the Void Ark, otherwise if they follow the compass they will end up far below the ark and need to find a way up to it.
