# OLD CHARACTER SECTION

Characters are important. Without them you cannot interact with the world of the game. Your character is your avatar and proxy in the game. While you can do anything you can think of in a role playing game, for the sake of fairness and playability some of your character's traits are distilled into numbers. While the statistics listed on your character sheet do not represent everything your character can do they should serve as a starting point.

## What Makes a Character

Characters are made up of many parts. However the 3 most important pieces are: Attributes, Stamina, and Skills.
### Attributes
Attributes come in 6 types: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, Magic, and Faith.
    Strength: Impacts melee attacks, melee damage, and carry capacity
    Dexterity: Impacts defense, ranged attacks, and reflex saves
    Constitution: Impacts maximum stamina, constitution saves
    Charisma: Impacts will saves, and leadership
    Magic: Impacts mana and maximum force of spells
    Faith: Impacts luck saves and faith refresh
#### Faith

Faith represents a character's inner grit and determination. Faith grants its rating as a bonus to luck rolls and gives character faith points or FP.

FP represents a character's ability to impose their will on the universe. It is a resource that characters can spend to reroll any die roll, though they must use the new result (unless they spend an FP to reroll that as well).

##### FP Refresh

The only way to restore FP is through honest rest. When characters rest in a safe area they refresh up to their maximum value of FP. Some areas or events may confer temporary bonuses to a characters FP. These bonuses fade the next time a character refreshes their FP. FP is never gained such as "+1 FP", but it reset to a set value although this never reduces a character's current rating. Thus if a character has 3 FP left and is allowed to refresh 1 FP they remain at 3 FP, while a character with 0 in the same situation is able to recover 1 FP..

### Stamina
Stamina represents a character's ability to avoid and mitigate harm. Its a measure of close calls, bruses, and fleshwounds. While it can be thought of as health and losing it can be thought of as damage it is less corporeal than that. Stamina recovers fully after an hour of rest, though some conditions such as mana burn can impead this recovery. When a character's stamina reaches 0 they receive a wound and then "Rally" recoving half their maximum stamina. Maximum stamina is determined by a character's class and their constitution.
    For more information on Stamina, Wounds, and Healing see Chapter 6 -- Systems.

### Mana
Mana is a shorthand for the myriad magical powers that infuses the world and the beings who inhabit it. Each tradition has different names for mana -- vis, thanergy, will -- they all work fundamentally the same. Mana is a resource that regenerates over time and allows mortals to use magic and shape the world. For most characters their maximum mana is equal to their magic.
Mana recovers by 1d4 every hour. Some items (such as tass) have the ability to restore mana on demand.

### Skills
There are 10 primary skills, this section gives an overview of them, for more information see the skill section later in this chapter.
    Alertness: Sometimes called perception, spot, or listen. Alertness is often used to notice things or determine initiative.
    Athletics: A measure of your physical abilities and coordination. Climb, Swim, Jump, Run.
    Medicine: Your knowledge and ability to perform first aid and other medical tasks. Used to diagnose and treat wounds.
    Performance: Your performative abilities.
    Persuasion: Your ability to convince others
    Search: The other part of perception. Whereas alertness is instant and reactive, search is deliberate and takes time.
    Stealth: Your ability to hide both yourself and your actions from notice.
    Survival: Your abiilty to navigate and survive in the wilderness
    Tinkering: Your crafting abiilty and knowledge
    Know: This skill covers multiple academic skills and is usually qualified with a discipline (Arcana, Religon, Local, etc).

## Creating Characters

In order to create a character you:
    - Determine your base attributes.
        Roll 2d6 for each attribute and consult the following chart. You may switch any 2 attributes of your choice.
            | Roll | Score |
            | :--: | :---: |
            |  2   |  -1   |
            | 3-5  |   0   |
            | 6-8  |  +1   |
            | 9-11 |  +2   |
            |  12  |  +3   |
        Or you may the following: 2,1,0,0,0,-1 and assign them as you wish.
    - Choose your race.
        Human
        Halfling
        Dwarf
        Elf
        If you wish to determine your race randomly roll 2d6 and consult the table:
            | Roll  |   Race   |

            |  2-3  |  Dwarf   |
            |  4-7  |  Human   |
            | 8-10  | Halfling |
            | 11-12 |   Elf    |
    - Choose a class (Fighter, Expert, Magic User, Adventurer)
        Note: Adventurer is a mix of 2 classes and allows healer and monk to be chosen.
    - Choose your skills.
        You have 12 points to allocate among your skills, unless you're an expert in which case you have 16.

    Pass: Gain +2 to your reputation temporarily
    Fail: Gain -2 to your reputation temporarily

    | Roll  | First Impression |
    | :---: | :--------------: |
    |  1-5  |        -1        |
    | 6-11  |        0         |
    | 12-16 |        +1        |
    |  16+  |        +2        |
### Search

Search a target area. Takes 1 turn per 10sq'. Opposed by any hidden objects stealth.

### Stealth

The ability to hide oneself and one's actions.

#### Hide
Being unnoticed is an ancient art. In order to hide you must have someplace to hide behind or someplace to be inconspiuous. Hide sets the DC required to spot the character.

#### Sleight of Hand
Palming, lifting, obscuring, or generally being sneaky. Sets the DC to be caught. When used against a particular target, roll against their passive alertness.

### Survival
Surival in the wilderness should never be taken for granted. The survival skill governs a host of related tasks: navigation, foraging, and tracking.
#### Navigation
A compass grants you +2 on your check and prevents you from veering the wrong direction.
    Critical Success: You find a shortcut and move 10% farther.
    Success: You move your max distance in the direction you set.
    Failure: You travel 4+1d6 x 10% of your max distance and become lost.
    Critical Failure: You veer and travel 4+1d6x10% of your distance in a new direction.

#### Foraging
Finding food that wont poison you in the wilderness can be difficult. It takes 1 watch to forage for food.
    Critical Success: Find 10+1d20 rations.
    Success: Find 10 rations.
    Failure: Find 1 ration.
    Critical Failure: Find 10 rations, but they make you ill.

#### Tracking
Following  quarry through the wildness takes patience and an eye for detail.
    Critical Success: You follow the trail and may move at full speed this watch.
    Success: You follow the trail, though you move at half speed this watch.
    Failure: You lose the trail and have to double back to find it, you do not move that watch.
    Critical Failure: You find a trail, but its the wrong one and takes you somewhere else.

### Tinkering
Making things, breaking things, and dreaming of new things to make all fall under tinkering.

#### Pick Lock
Anyone with a small amount of skill can pick a lock eventually, but where is the fun in 'eventually'? You use pick lock to quickly and quietly pick open a lock. The DC is set by the lock.
    Critical Success: You deal with the lock so deftly that you can leave it locked to everyone but yourself and only someone clearly more skilled than you can notice it was tampered with.
    Success: You open the lock, though someone skilled may notice it was tampered with.
    Failure: You get through the lock quickly OR quietly, you choice and someone skilled would probably notice it has been tampered with..
    Critical Failure: You do not get through the lock and you damage it in the process rendering it broken.

    Note: You cannot take 10 on a pick lock check.

#### Disable Device
Traps have been the end of many adventuerers, this is one way to avoid them. After finding a trap, the trick is to stop it from hurting you. The DC is set by the trap.
    Critical Success: You have disabled the trap and can rearm it at your will.
    Success: You have disabled the trap, but rearming it will take some time.
    Failure: You didn't disable it, you think, but you also didn't set it off, you think.
    Critical Failure: You fool. You set off the trap.

See the systems chapter for details on crafting or uncrafting.
