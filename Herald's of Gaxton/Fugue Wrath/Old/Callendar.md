# Calendar and time tracking

The Chronas Calendar was created and adopted in the 23rd year of the 1st age. The months were named after the divine saints that cast down Calix and began the age of Mortals. The days of the week were named after the elements. The festival days were named for the Gods. The moons were named for Chronas' 5 daughters. This calendar has spread accross the world, but is not heavily used outside the cascades.

12 months with 28 days each followed by 5 festival days.
Each week has 7 days. There are 4 weeks in a month.
5 Moons (one has fallen at the end of the 3rd age)
