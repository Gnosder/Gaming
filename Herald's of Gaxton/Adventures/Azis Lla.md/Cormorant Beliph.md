# Cormorant Beliph

The second delve into Asiz Lla. This leads into the second of the 2 living areas on the ship. This one was reserved for crew and their families, though it has a straight tie to Aleph. In the ship's current state, however, many security doors are closed pending a restart of the security system (Fail closed).

The cormorant is over run with malfunctioning hospitality drones, however they are mostly harmless. The central vizier node has been infected with redQueen.exe but was able to quarantine itself before fully failing. This has not stopped in from slowly corrupting other hositality frames, however. 

The delve has a static boss fight, needed to lift the quarantine blockade in place, as well as several wandering encounters.

Boss: redQueen.exe

Wandering Encounters:

Street Cleaner grayKnight.exe (miniboss; roadhog)

Exterminator fellGuard.exe (miniboss; raging raven)

Courier blueBolt.exe (fragile, but quick; avoids combat; plays keep-away; phat loot)
    collects loot and valuables for the redQueen. Nest is on top of Vizier control.

Maid Patrol (non-combat; just a lot of maid frames doing maid things, mostly right)

Doormate Agust (non-combat; doorman, can make small talk (only if language mod installed in bridge))

Defeating the redQueen lifts the quarantine on the Cormorant and allows access to teh security control center, Aliph, the Menagiery, and Sophia.
