Lore:
Transmat
"it seems you have to be within range and beacons or receivers are often used as waypoints to send information to. Also transmat often leave unique signatures. Plus the trans-materialisation is described as an electrical blast.

So we can glean from this that information is indeed being sent at the speed of light between two points. The fact that range is important indicates the signal will deteriorate over range. I'd say transmat beacons probably act as signal amplifiers that extend the signals range. "

"

Can't think of anything specifically calling it out, but it's implied several times in D2 that some sort of network or interconnected signal is required, supporting the D1 lore - things like the Adventures that involve luring Cabal into explosives (transmat beacons are used to steal and then redeploy the explosives), or even any time we've had to run back to our ship at the end of a mission because we were unable to be simply transmatted out of danger.

(In fact, though this falls pretty firmly in the realm of headcanon, but I'm fairly sure that Raid and Public Event Banners are actually transmat beacons used to send us more ammo in preparation for a dangerous mission.)
