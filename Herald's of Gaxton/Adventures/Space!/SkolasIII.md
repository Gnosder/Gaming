# Skolas III

The third planet of the Skolas system. While Skolas Prime houses an Eliksni Colony and the House of Wolves, Skolas III is an Ice Giant with remnant Vex tech and several glimmer wells.

        Note: A program to handle several different calanders at once (Agalia, Eliksni, Galactic Standard, etc.)

On [INSERT DATE] the ketch 'Changeship Irivkon-myr', captained by Ship Kell Misraaks failed to check in with the House of Changes on Riis. Fearing for their Archon, the house summoned their other two Archons, Tystran-froz and Corvax-Gyr (Newly returned to Riis). Neither could lead the rescure as both were already endebted to another (Tystran to the house's colony on Pitkos II, and Corvax to the great dragon Midgardsomor), but Corvax enlisted the aid of the Heroes of Gaxton to do so in his place. Granted the use of the the ketch 'Changeship of Eboloks-fes' and granted the temporary rank of Archon the Heroes began their investigation into the missing ketch.

Near the planet Skolas III an Eliksni distress signal is located, and it's origin appears to be at a Vex conflux that has recently been activated. A Geth scout patrol is also on scene performing an investigation of their own. No sign ot the missing ketch is found.
After clearing the Geth, the distress signal changes and a Vex wormway opens with Misraaks telling them to find him. From then on Misraaks will assist through the vex network as best he can.

    What happened to Misraaks? Vex activity had been documented via scans, Glimmer mining was halted and Misraaks sent to investigate. A Vex beam of some sort disabled the ship and transported it into the vex network. They are now under attack by Vex frames, mostly Goblins and Harpies. He has sliced into the Vex Net to attempt to find an escape. (Unknown to him, the Clan of Dark Rising of the House of Wolves has gone rouge and is using Vex tech in an attempt to capture misraaks. The Vex are just doing Vex things).

Enter dungeon "Skolas Vex Net". Clear the way through the net with Misraak's aid (Survive vex encounters until the way is opened). Defeat the Minotaur and forces assaulting the Ketch and escape the vex net. Side area of the net has dead Eliksni revealing the house of darkness and raising questions.
