# The Tempered Cistern

Is a small, 6th level adventure for the Heroes of Gaxton. 

Even though the wrath has mostly faded from Berin, pockets still remain, posing a dire threat to any unfortunates who stumble into it. The underground storeroom of an abandoned camp on the Wrathside of the Barrier River has begun to fester and has collapsed into a cistern. An agency expedition has gone missing in the area and Ser Daedric has asked the heroes to investigate.

## On beginnings

Ser Daedric approaches the heroes, who he knows want to get back into action, and tells them that an expedition has gone missing. It was supposed to be a simple day trip into an old boat landing the agency used to use to see if it was servicable, but they have failed to report back. The agency scryers have lost track of most of the group, but know that Miles Warde is still in the area.

## The Boat Landing

As you guide your boat ashore you see a second, similar boat moared not far from you, its markings show it to be with the agency. The agency boat looks whole, but abandoned. Clearly no one has been there in the last few days.

You look around the landing. You see where the buildings once stood, now reclaimed by nature, and your mind takes you back to your last time here. You remember all the explorers turned into wrath infested zombies throwing themselves at you and your first meeting with Hilda. You can still smell the wrath, its sweet-sulpher auroma swirling around you. This time, however, there is no wrath. Had you not known about the missing agents this would seem a peaceful place.

In the shade of large tree you see the remains of a campfire. What do you do?

Explore:
    Campfire -- been out for several days
    Camp -- Some supplies remain, looks like it was to be a base camp rather than a temporary camp.
    Compound -- The buildings are all but gone, almost fully consumed by nature. Footprints can be found. They move around the area, but ultimately lead to an opening in the ground that was once the entrance to an underground store room.
    Store Room -- Blood and dirt... and wrath. An agency exploreer is propped up against a wall, unconcious and breathing heavily, his side wrapped in blood stained rags. The far corner of the room is an earie darkness that seems to consume light.

    Miles Warde -- Human, 5'10", explorer with the agency under Ser Uric Gorste. Greviously wounded by Ser Gorste and wants to go home. He is dying. He knows Ser Gorste had been infected by wrath and had taken the rest of the group into what he thinks is a cistern.

## The Tempered Cistern

The darkness of the storeroom gives way into a dense, steaming jungle. A simple path has been cleared in the jungle ahead. Footprints and a blood trail can be found there. Following the trail leads to the Ziggurat, but also crosses the path of some demons that live outside it.
