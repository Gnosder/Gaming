# Azis Lla Readme

Azis Lla is a dungeon complex. It has 5-7 Delves with each being 4-9 encounters each.

The first delve would take the party to the bridge to gain access to the others.

# Delve 1 -- Journey to the Bridge

The devle starts at the top of the ship, by the aetherite. The ship has been locked down. An alternate path is needed. Going through a maintence hatch that can be accesed through a vent. The orb has an override.

Ryan Pierce, who has been researching the station, is trapped in a side room near the bridge. He requires assistance. He has sent the orb, which he has named Beacon, to assist the characters.

Delves unlocked: Cormorant Beliph

# Delve 2 -- The Genesis of Sophia

Unlocked: Full Azis Lla control.

# Delve 3 -- Cormorant Beliph

Now that the lockdown has been ended the bridge returns to its normal spot and the security door blocking the Cormorant is opened. Several other security doors remain locked, however, as full security control cannot be reistablished and several "High Incidence" routes have been flagged as dangerous and needing security intervention (which is not happening).

This delve goes through the second (and smaller) dormicary which has been flagged as an appropriate route to the security control.

Several of the hospitality frames have been malfunctioning and have caused many of the servitors to fail as well.

Open site crawl through a large living area (2k people, mostly staff quarters).)

# Delve 4 -- The Weeping Menagerie

Delve unlocked: The Genisis of Sophia

# Delve 5 -- Security Conscious Control
