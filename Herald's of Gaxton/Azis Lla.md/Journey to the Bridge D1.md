# Journey to the Bridge

Summary: Ryan Pierce has gotten himself into trouble. While attempting to reach the bridge he was chased into a side room by an aggresive security morph that stalks the bridge area. After dispatching Beacon, an Allagan Orb droid, to send a distress signal and escort rescuers to him he has setteled in to wait. Beacon directs the players to a maintence hatch that can be accesed throuh an air vent that it can override the security for. From the hatch the characters travel through a maintence tunnel, a diagnostics panel indicates dengerously poor air quality on the path. Beacon plots a new route to aquire the means to traverse the path. After leaving the maintence area they discover a large mycelium outgrowth around their origonal path. The alternate path takes them towards one of the Lab-Island's access zone. An encounter with aggressive security drones, a desicated terrarium with a hostile and starving ant swarm, lead into an air lock. Inside the air lock are a handful of still operable rebreathers that can filter out toxins as well as a few hazmat suits (though they are no longer air tight). The airlock leads into the mycelium research lab-island (connected by a long tunnel). After getting the rebreathers they can take the primary path which leads through a fungi overrun section of the ship. Shriekers and Acid Spores are among the fungai found there. A secuirty scan informs them that "indtruders detected. dispatching security morph." They are ambushed by a damaged secuirty frame (miniboss) and then have to fight through more security drones to reach Ryan Peirce. From there they can access the bridge, but the other security frame is still around and will attack them on the bridge. Once the bridge is secure they gain full control over the ship, however, some parts are damaged and/or inoperable.
