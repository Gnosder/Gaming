# GW2 Planning

Gw2 is a big game and there are lots of things to do and goals to focus on. With my ADHD I need to write my goals down so I know what to do.

Events > Manditory Masteries > Mounts > Legendaries

Mounts: Skyscale > Griffon > Beetle > Turtle

## Classes

I want to focus on the light armor classes: Necromancer, Mesmer, and Elementalist; Park other classes at important nodes.
    Each should have a good open world build, a group content (raid) build, and another utility (WvW, or another raid)

Mesmer Condi Virt:

Mesmer Chrono Support Healer: Full Harrier, Scepter, Shield, Rifle, Sigil of Transference, Sigil of Paralyzation, Rune of the Monk, Relic of the Flock (Barrior), Febe (Swiftness), Healing Infusion, Delicious Rice Balls, Bountiful Maintenence Oil.
