## Venom Burger

A new fast food has taken the city by storm. Those who eat at 'Venom Burger' can't help but keep coming back. Is it really that good or is there something else at play?

The burger meat is vegan and supplied by a local farm that uses spirit augmented beans in the patties. The burgers are slowly attuning those who eat them to the spirit world in preparation for a massive summoning ritual to call forth an idigam. Neither the farmers or the restaurant know about the plot. The owner of them both, however, has been planning for some time.
