# Backpack Adventures

A collection of one-shots, intro adventures, and misc games that I can pull out and play on the spot.

# Fantasy(Dark) Mork-Borg?
# Fantasy(Epic)
# Fantasy(Adventure) OSR
# Cyberpunk
# Scifi
# Dresden Files (mystery-ish)
    I want 2-3 adventures (2-3 sessions each) for up to 5 people with loose pregens.

    For the first one, do the spirit body swap one.
    Spirit spider venom into burgers to control people.

## Spirit of the City

Mandy summoned the spirit Arada to helpher study for exams (she's a knowledge spirit), but the summoning went awry when a creature chasing arada followed. Arada possessed Mindy and fled while the hunter started to chase her. Now Mindy is without a body and fading fast. Dr. Samantha Eliot, is trying to figure out what happened and has hired the PCs. That-which-hunts-the-dark is chasing Arada in Mindy's body to consume her. Duke Marcel De Sanguine, vampire prince of the city, is hunting Arada as well, knowledge spirits are valubale. Arada is just trying to survive.
