The idea here is to hit on a simple, somewhat abstracted system for wealth that gives the idea some nuance without having to track every stray copper.

# Idea 1 -- Resources

Each character a resources stat represented by a number and a place for tracking incomes.

A character expends resources to purchase items. Resources can be increased from regular income sources or one off payments.
* Purchasing an item follows this basic format: If an item is 1 or more points under a character's resources then the character can afford it; if the item's value is equal to the character's resources, then the character can purchase it but their resource score drops by 1. If the item is greater than a character's resource score they must take out a loan from somewhere, mechanically loans allow the character to buy the item, but have a buyout price (10x the item's cost?) and costs the character 1 or more resource points each period until the buyout cost is met.

Each period (month/season/year/etc.) a character's resources increases to their income score (only if it was lower), then the character pays at least 1 resource point for each loan they have. If they cannot pay for a loan, they go into arrears for that loan (this is concering for all of a character's loans). After spending 3 periods in Arrears the loan must be paid back in full by the next period along with a 20% late fee. If the loan is not repaid fully by the 4th period after beginning arrears the charater defaults on that loan. A character that defaults on a loan must, within 2 periods pay off all other loans (or immidiatly default on them as well) and permaently reduce each current income source by 1.

Each year, a character's resources can drop by 1 (this represents the spending habits and lifestyle of the individual). This loss will never take a charater below their income.

Example: A character owns a restaurant that is moderately profitable, granting them an income of 4. On the side they are an adventurer and, after a particularly good adventure, gain 8 resources. Their current resource score is 8. This score can decrease over time (1 per year) or by spending it to purchase goods and/or services. The score of 8 cannot decrease below 4, as that is the character's income.

Set period at 3 months (quarterly) reset scale to reflect that.

Resource Scale and rough values

| 4              | $2,000,000        | Wealthy          | 10,000             |

Goods can be created in region or imported. Ways to import in a magical world: Over land (slow, medium vol), over sea (slow, high vol), By air (fast, med vol), Portal (Instant, small vol). List item volumes in M^3 (cubic meters) to make life easy.

    4 speeds: Slow, Med, Fast, Instant
    4 Volumes: Low, Med, High, Very High

    By price by speed: Portal > Air > Ground > Sea
    By price per Vol: Portal > Air > Ground > Sea

    If we abstract costs and prices to the Koku (the amout of rice a person eats in a year) and account for infastructure and population, we learn that every 1 square kilometer of land produces ~400 Koku and supports ~400 people. (this is the high end.)
        Try ~50 people per sq km. It would break down to 1 non-peasent to 9 peasents
