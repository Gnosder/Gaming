# Adalesca

A large continent in the frozen north. Once setteled by a hextech explorer looking for the mythical "Valley of Lost Time". The first settelment was the port town of Southpoint, which is where the first ARK was built*. While the valley was never found* the rich metal deposits of the land soon attracted miners and investors. The small town of Southport soon outgrew its ARK, fortunately prospectors had moved further north and established the city of Glinthaven* in a covered vale, an ARK was added soon after. Tensions began to rise with the natives and the Beast War began. A coalition of Orcs and Giants began raiding the supply lines between Soutpoint and Glinthaven. The war was finally ended when a mercenary company sent by the Consortium sacked the "Castle of the Beast*" and dispersed the beastmen.

Shortly after the end of the war other nations began to build mines on the continent which flousihed into towns. The collapse of the Northern Way Shipping Guild threw the area into disarray. New alliances were formed as the city states of Adalesca came together in an uneasy alliance, though each still maintained ties to its founding nation.

## ARKs

A large magitech heater that has the ability to create a heated 'bubble' around it in which a town can comfortably exist. 

## Valley of Lost Time

A land before time type valley underground. Was actually found by the expedition, but it never made it back to civilization.


## A good start...

### Homegrown Heroes

The village of Goldcrest is too small to house an ARK, but maintains an old military ARA (much smaller, less efficient ARK). It is in this town that a group of young folk first hear the call of advanture.

Characters begin in Goldcrest just before their initing adventure.

### On wings of black

After the Beast War the mecenary company of the Serrated Spears mostly left Adalesca, but a few remained behind. They became known as the Black Company and are a well respected (though not venerated) institution and a go-to for any Beastmen related problems. This is their story...
