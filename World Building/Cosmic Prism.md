# Cosmic Prism

The name for my universe within my reality that holds all the material worlds.

# Rules

Broken up into celestial ages. Most material worlds only last 1-2 celestial ages, not fully down to time but rather the cataclysms that tend to end each age, but some last much longer.

The Ages:
- Age of Genesis: The time when the universe was created by the 6 Gods. Nothing existed before.
- Age of Infestation: Hell formed and demons began to spread into existence.
- Age of Strife: A devil rallyed the forces of Hell to launch an organized assault on the prism.
- Age of Silence: The chained God bound Hell; The 6 and the forces of hell retreated from sight.
- Age of Winter: A cosimic Ice age ravaged the prism as the Chained God's prior domains failed.
- Age of Warlords: Without the Gods, powerful mortals attempted to exert control over the Prism.
- Age of Void: Agents from the void invaded the prism. The warlords came together to defeat them.
- Age of the Firstborn: The warlords came together as Firstborn to form a united council of sorts. The Firstborn killed the Void Hive world of Cath'illium.
- Age of Summer: The Cosmic ice age thaws, travel between worlds becomes easier. Strife increases.
- Age of Expansion: Various non-firstborn powers begin to expand their boarders and enter into conflict. The firstborn do not engage.
