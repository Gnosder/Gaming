# Danansk

An ancient world of the cosmic prism.

It was created at the beginning, but societies did not arise until the Age of Strife. The world did not make external contact until the age of summer.

*Cosmic Age* Standard Age

*Age of Strife*/Fearful Dark -- the primative peoples came together in fear. The origins of the races: 3 human tribes, 2 Dwarf Clans, 1 Elven Glade; 5 Beast Klaves, 3 Orc Clans, 1 Giant Tribe; 4 Halfling Troupes, 2 Dragonborn flights.

Great Light -- A golden age of advancement and mostly good relations.

*Age of Silence* Empty Night --As the Gods retreated, the light faded and the golden age crumbled.

*Age of Winter* Magic began to stagnate and weaken. In an effort to combat this Elven King performed a ritual that backfired and dropped the world into a even deeper dark age.

*Age of Warlords* The magical angst of the age caused the fractured peoples to come back together. It was a reawakening of sorts.

War of Heirs -- Various factions tried to claim dragonblood to prove they deserved to reopen the mythical city of Myr.

*Age of Void* -- Void creatures spilled out of the Dragonstone gate and destroyed the mythial city of Myr. Many of the survivers were void touched. The war against the Seeping Void began.

*Age of the Firstborn* -- the forces of the void mysteriously vanished, but its influence remained and continued to spawn horrors on its own.

*Age of Summer* -- Magic begins to grow in intensity, the world was visited by Eladrin Hearthguides and an embasy was formed in the reclaimed city of myr, but the world itself did not join the prisim proper (no firstborn or global power).

*Age of Expansion* -- Refugees of a Fallen world shelter in Danansk's frozen south pole.
