A campaign set in the northen continent of Adalesca on the world Hyperion.

## Humble Beginnings

A group of individuals embark on a new career as adventurers. They begin in the small community of Granmist, either from the town proper or the outskirts. They start under the tutaliage of an aged, retired adventurer named Cornelius Feng. Cornelius will put them through their paces until a routine job gone south leads to something larger.

"The room is small and sparsly decorated, a few benches along the side and a dirt floored sparring circle in the middle. Cornelius Feng stands at the front of the room and regards the people seated on the benchs. 'I told you all that adventuring is dangerous. That most of use don't make it home. I've told you of the terrors we face and the monsters we battle. Of the terrible price we pay. And yet you're all here. So fine, I'll teach you. I'll show you what I know and maybe you'll survive long enough to realize that it's not for you. In any event, you'd best get familiar with each other. I'm sure most of you know each other, but let's do introductions anyways. Who are you, why do you want to be an adventurer and who dropped you as a child that made you the way you are?'"

Cornelius Feng -- Old, jaded, scarred in and out. Speaks with a harsh candor and a hyperbolic cynacism. Human, Male, Fighter, mid-60s, long grey uncempt hair.

"Ventuering ain't always glamourous, in fact in most cases it't not. We're often low-rent mcercenaries with the occational forgotten tomb or decaying ruin. At worst we're cheap postal workers. It's on the low end that we'll be starting today. Millian Granmist is having issues on his farm, typical run of the mill gophers. That said, if they stay  there too long they could attract something more dangerous, like a bullet or a gryphon. So, you're going to go out to Farmer Millian's farm and deal with those Gophers. You're not doing it for free, mind you. He's paying a fee for your time and effort. I'll take my cut, as any guild would, and you'll split the rest. Questions?"

### Gopher Chasers

Farmer Millian Granmist is having gopher troubles on his farm and he needs someone(s) to deal with them. 

(Skill challenge to pull out gophers. Combat challenge against a currious Owlbear drawn by the sounds, Investigation and Tracking challenge to find the owlbears den and why it left)

#### Millian's Farm

One of the largest farms in the community, several miles out of town proper, and on the edge of the Granmist Foreset. This field was growing ipopo (a starchy, yam-like tubber) before the gophers moved in.

"It's no normal rodent infest. Let me tell you. I can normally deal with this devils on my own or with my hands, but not this time. Too many of the buggers." Farmer Millian takes the ventuers to the effected field. A large 2 acre plot that once housed neat rows of tubbers, but is now a mess of mounds and holes. Several dozen gophers are visible relaxing in the sunlight or contentedly eating their stolen yams. This is no mere infestation, more like a gopher army. "What do you think? Can you kill the buggers? I don't want to have to slash and burn the field to get rid of them, but that's the only idea I have on my own."

There are lots of ways to get rid of them. The gophers are fat and lazy, they wont put up too much of a fight (note, this is not combat, though it could be if that is the route the players go. The gophers will flee on their turns.) As a skill challenge the Players must suceed at 5 checks (each taking about an hour) before they fail at 4. If they succeeed the surviving gophers flee. If they fail the owlbear ambushes them and tries to drag off a PC before the others can react.

"Well, that's one way to clear a field! I guess your fee is well earned today. Many thanks for your help and... frozen spit, what is that?" A large, but haggard looking owlbear saunters out of the forest. It does not seem concerned by the nearby people and heads over to the (presumably extant and nearby) pile of dead gophers. If they're edible it grabs one and begins eating happily, otherwise it just sniffs the pile. "You've a new mark, I reckon! Get that blasted thing off my land!"

The owlbear does not want to leave, it will engage in combat but will attempt to flee if bloodied or if it can drag off an unconcious character. It fights with its bulk and is not in any way subtle.

As the fight ends (one way or another) Cornelius jogs up, slightly winded from his exertion, a short sword sheathed at his side and a buckler strapped to his arm. "Well, good, looks like you were able to deal with the beast on your own. Best get after it though, it's well out of its territory and wouldn't have come this far east without a very good reason." "You're fee for this one will come out of the town's till, it's what taxes pay for after all."

#### After the Bear

The owl bear took off into the forest (presumably wounded and alone, sad), it will notice as soon as someone gives chases (novice adventurers are not as good as an owl bear) and drop anything it has to speed off deeper into the forest. The bear has a temporary lair beneath a fallen log and has made a nest out of leaves and the furry remains of its meals. A 3/2 skill challenge leads to it or, if 3/0, leads to the bear and then the lair. Examining the bear or the lair reveals strange clues. 1. The bear has fresh scars on its back that were caused by magic (necrotic damage). 2. Near the lair (in the bear's spore) a necrotic seed has sprouted and begun kiling plants around it.

Whether the bear is killed or the lair is destroyed, the PCs will receive their reward when they return to Cornelius.
"Well done, not a bad run for your first venture. Way to roll with the punches, or claws as it were. Take a rest, you've earned it. I'm going to send word to some friends further afield with the information you've found."

FIN.

### Raiders a Raiding

"Cornelius pulls you all together with a great urgency. 'A Skoll Raiding party has been spotted advancing on Grinmist by the Sea a few miles away. The local garrison and militia will deal with them, in fact they probably already have, but there's always too much to do in the aftermath of battles and too few people. So I'm sending you out to assist. You'll be delivering a cart of supplies, medical and foodstuffs, and then assisting the local garrison in any way they need. Your contact in the town will be Sergent Second-class Amelia Dalion. Your fee will be paid by Grinmist by the Sea. Questions?'"

The road to Grinmist by the Sea is well worn and easy traveling. A mile out of town a few pillars of black smoke can be seen, at the edge of town a few groups of towns folk (unable to serve in the militia) sit together, having fled from the front line. The fighting is over, but this raid was worse than 'normal' and captives were taken (normally the skoll just want supplies and a fight). The townsfolk don't know much, but can direct the pcs to Dalion.
Dalion is over seeing the reconstruction of palasades just off the beach. She understands your pourpose at a glance and spares no time in giving orders. "Those of you who can skilled at medicine, report to Medic Stedan over there, the rest of you are helping build defenses. I fear a second attack is emmanent." This is a skill challenge 5/3 to prepare the town, the challenge takes 4 hours, after which the town is as ready as it will be and must wait. At midnight a skoll longboat appears on the horizon and bears down on the beach. The defenders launch several arrow volleys (fire arrows if the challegne was successful) before the longboat grinds into the shore and the raiders leap off, war cries to their death god on their lips. The raider's fight with abandon and even though they are outnumbered 3:1 they make their pressence felt. (8 raiders, medium armor; they fight until slain).

"Never before have I seen such a thing. This assult was suicide and yet they did it gladdly. They fought to the end. No plunder is worth that. What is going on?" Dalion. "Our casualties here were higher than I was expecting. I'm sending for reinforcements, but this-- fervor-- of theres has me worried. The raiders took captives in the first assault and getting them back has become more important than ever. I don't have the manpower to protect the town and recover the captives, but I do have you. Take this longboat to Sealrock island, just out there, that'll be were the raiders have moored. Recover our townsfolk however you need to and, if you can, drive off the rest of the skool." They think there were 2 boats(though there was only one).

The townsfolk have already been sacrificed to Nuul, death god of the Skoll, the sacrifice ment to summon the souls of the dead raiders back into immortal undeath. The island is empty save for a Skoll priest chanting in the middle of the slain townsfolk. The area quickly turns into a horror movie though as ghostly skool emerge from the water and attack the pcs once the priest has been bloodied. When the priest is slain the ghostly skoll vanish in anguished cries.

"When you arrive home a grim Cornelius meets you. 'I've heard the news from Grinmist by the Sea and my contacts are reporting other strange occurances happening across the fjord. Get some rest, but be back here first thing in the morning. We have work to do.'" He wont talk about what it is or give any details.

### The lost dwarves

"In the morning, seeming more terse than ever, Cornelius gives out the job. 'For a few winters now a small group of Dwarves have set up shop in an old keep to the north, at the edge of the Grizzly Hills. We were expecting their traders a few weeks ago, but they didn't come. Normally I'd pay it no mind, but after the last few days-- something happened to them, I know it in my bones. Go to their keep and find out what happened. I'll pay your fee."

Travel to the keep is straight foreward for the first half of the trip, moving along a worn trade road winding south-east from the steppes. The turn from the main road toward the keep is marked, but only just. The road itself is more of a game trail than a road, normal carts would struggle to navigate it.

Travel between Granmist and the keep takes 3 days. A navigation check is needed to follow the trail. On a pass, arrive at the keep near noon on the 3rd day; else, arrive at dusk.

The keep has been infested by ghouls, the dwarves are mostly dead, though 3 remain barricaded in a room deeper into the keep. The ghouls broke through a tunnel wall in the mine beneath the keep. The ghouls emerge to hunt at night and will ambush anyone camped ouside the keep. They will not leave the keep during the day and will retreat to the mines if needed.

Spooky location crawl, ala dead space, with ghouls coming out at random. They should be powerful and always retreat when taken low. Find a already destroyed ghoul with a blessed warhammer. If they have radiant damage sources or turn undead the ghouls will flee into the mine and try to hide. Objective: Find or account for all the Dwarves.

On returning to Cornelius: "Damn it all to the pit! The Lord here has already put Granmist into lockdown and, while aid is still coming to Granmist by the Sea, they've been told to 'temper their expectations'. I've yet to hear from the Guild in Anor Lundra, but it's only a matter of time. You have some time to rest, but be prepared for a whirlwind."

Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout are the surviving dwarves.

## Call to the Capital

"Cornelus calls the team together. 'I've gotten word from the guild. They want us at the capital. All of us. Things must be worse than I thought if they want me to bring greenhorns like you. So, before we go, I'll ask you one more time, are you sure you want to be adventurers? Last chance to bow out. No? Fine, but I did warn you. We'll leave tomorrow. We'll be taking some wounded from Granmist by the Sea with us. Dalion didn't want them to stay here in case another attack comes.' 

In the time between the conversation and the caravan there are things that can be done, if desired. Any actions to help the caravan prepare should be rolled. If there are more successes than failures, the caravan leaves on time and all members gain +2 morale to all checks until the end. If there are at least 2 rolls and no failures the bonus increases to +4. Otherwise the caravan leaves late, at midday the next day instead of dawn (this makes corneleus grumpy, but not much else).

Travel to the capital has a chance for 2 T1 random encounters and one gauranteed encounter. The third encounter happens about a day out from the capital. 

### Refugee Caravan

A train of refugees wind slowly onto the road from a game trail. They are tired and clearly left in a hurry. They'll tell that their home was attacked by Skoll raiders that couldn't die so they were forced to flee. Tug the strings. The guard 'captain' is a young girl, 17, who is the only one left with combat training after all the guards died defending the village. Her father was the reeve. There is someone else left from the militia, but he's too wounded to walk or do much. He needs medical treatment and infection is setting in.

### The capital; Anor Lunda

On arriving in the capital, Cornelius sends the caravan to the temple district while he users the ventuerers to the guild. There isn't a lot of time for sight seeing as he sets a rapid pace. The guild building is old, but well maintained. Built in the dwarven fashion the building itself is mostly a box, but the walls are covered in geometric patterns and reliefs. The inside of the building is spartan and functional. A large table is set up in the rear and a number of humanoids are gathered around it.

"A stocky dwarf looks up as cornelius enters the room. 'You're late, had you gotten here sooner I'd have something good for you to do. These your new blood?' Cornelius nods curtly. 'We've gotten a requeset for investigtors from the church of the Golden Grace. Normally low priority, but these days I wouldn't discount it. Meet Sister Gentle Grace and see what she needs. Questions?" "Dismissed." (Why low prio? Normally the only investigating is for crimes, not our bag. They turn to us when the guard is too busy to help them. We typically punt to some local PIs, or at worst send out some of our newer members. Who pays our fee? A fair question in any other times. Right now we're all hands on deck so your fee is being paid out by the guild, with a bonus. Downside is you can't refuse a job unless you're leaving the guild for good.What else has been going on? Immortal/undead skoll raiders, undead appearing places they shouldn't be, a 'dimming' of faith based magics. What is the guild doing about it? Scouts sent to icecrown to see what's happening, emesaries sent to the storm giants, Elves, and Dragons. Scouts sent into Drullkas. Plus an overflowing number of monster hunting requests.)

### The Church of Golden Grace

People have begun leaving other churches to join the the Brotherhood of Immortal Blood, a mystery cult that has popped up, this is normally fine. However, some of those people have been disappearing, particularly the poor and untouchables (people the CHurch of Golden Grace works with). Investigate the disappearances and the cult (don't get caught). Deal with the vampire coven at its heart.

The coven will have a clue that points to a Skoll jarl building up his forces at an old stronghold on the coast.
