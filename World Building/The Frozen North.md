A campaign set in the northen continent of Adalesca on the world Hyperion.

## Humble Beginnings

A group of individuals embark on a new career as adventurers. They begin in the small community of Granmist, either from the town proper or the outskirts. They start under the tutaliage of an aged, retired adventurer named Cornelius Feng. Cornelius will put them through their paces until a routine job gone south leads to something larger.

"The room is small and sparsly decorated, a few benches along the side and a dirt floored sparring circle in the middle. Cornelius Feng stands at the front of the room and regards the people seated on the benchs. 'I told you all that adventuring is dangerous. That most of use don't make it home. I've told you of the terrors we face and the monsters we battle. Of the terrible price we pay. And yet you're all here. So fine, I'll teach you. I'll show you what I know and maybe you'll survive long enough to realize that it's not for you. In any event, you'd best get familiar with each other. I'm sure most of you know each other, but let's do introductions anyways. Who are you, why do you want to be an adventurer and who dropped you as a child that made you the way you are?'"

Cornelius Feng -- Old, jaded, scarred in and out. Speaks with a harsh candor and a hyperbolic cynacism. Human, Male, Fighter, mid-60s, long grey uncempt hair.

"Ventuering ain't always glamourous, in fact in most cases it't not. We're often low-rent mcercenaries with the occational forgotten tomb or decaying ruin. At worst we're cheap postal workers. It's on the low end that we'll be starting today. Millian Granmist is having issues on his farm, typical run of the mill gophers. That said, if they stay  there too long they could attract something more dangerous, like a bullet or a gryphon. So, you're going to go out to Farmer Millian's farm and deal with those Gophers. You're not doing it for free, mind you. He's paying a fee for your time and effort. I'll take my cut, as any guild would, and you'll split the rest. Questions?"

### Gopher Chasers

Farmer Millian Granmist is having gopher troubles on his farm and he needs someone(s) to deal with them. 

(Skill challenge to pull out gophers. Combat challenge against a currious Owlbear drawn by the sounds, Investigation and Tracking challenge to find the owlbears den and why it left)

#### Millian's Farm

One of the largest farms in the community, several miles out of town proper, and on the edge of the Granmist Foreset. This field was growing ipopo (a starchy, yam-like tubber) before the gophers moved in.

"It's no normal rodent infest. Let me tell you. I can normally deal with this devils on my own or with my hands, but not this time. Too many of the buggers." Farmer Millian takes the ventuers to the effected field. A large 2 acre plot that once housed neat rows of tubbers, but is now a mess of mounds and holes. Several dozen gophers are visible relaxing in the sunlight or contentedly eating their stolen yams. This is no mere infestation, more like a gopher army. "What do you think? Can you kill the buggers? I don't want to have to slash and burn the field to get rid of them, but that's the only idea I have on my own."

There are lots of ways to get rid of them. The gophers are fat and lazy, they wont put up too much of a fight (note, this is not combat, though it could be if that is the route the players go. The gophers will flee on their turns.) As a skill challenge the Players must suceed at 5 checks (each taking about an hour) before they fail at 4. If they succeeed the surviving gophers flee. If they fail the owlbear ambushes them and tries to drag off a PC before the others can react.

"Well, that's one way to clear a field! I guess your fee is well earned today. Many thanks for your help and... frozen spit, what is that?" A large, but haggard looking owlbear saunters out of the forest. It does not seem concerned by the nearby people and heads over to the (presumably extant and nearby) pile of dead gophers. If they're edible it grabs one and begins eating happily, otherwise it just sniffs the pile. "You've a new mark, I reckon! Get that blasted thing off my land!"

The owlbear does not want to leave, it will engage in combat but will attempt to flee if bloodied or if it can drag off an unconcious character. It fights with its bulk and is not in any way subtle.

As the fight ends (one way or another) Cornelius jogs up, slightly winded from his exertion, a short sword sheathed at his side and a buckler strapped to his arm. "Well, good, looks like you were able to deal with the beast on your own. Best get after it though, it's well out of its territory and wouldn't have come this far east without a very good reason." "You're fee for this one will come out of the town's till, it's what taxes pay for after all."
