# Adventurous Fractal Template (AFT)

The AFT can be used to build any level of game. From a sweeping campaign to a singal session romp. This is accomplished by neting more AFTs inside of each other, with each new AFT drilling down a level until the game arrives at session level play.

When it comes to scope there are 4: Campaign, Arc, Adventure, Session. A campaign is defined as the entirety of a game and contains 2+ arcs; to use a television series as an example, the campaign would be the entierety of the series. An arc is a longer part of a campaign and contains 2+ adventures, comparable to a season in the prior example. An adventure is a single idea or story and is played in 1+ sessions, this would be a single episode of the series. Finally, the session is a single, continuous play experience that is designed to be run in a 2 hour block. The session does not have a comparision to a tv series or any other piece of media because it it not measured in *dramatic* time, but rather *actual* (IRL) time. How much of the content that can be played through depends on the group of players and real life secheduling.

The *actual* time tracking of a session implies 2 things: first, that the other scopes are played in *dramatic* time, and second, [I forgot what I was going to say].
