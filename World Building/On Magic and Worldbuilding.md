Let's add on to and adapt Medieval Demographics made Easy (MDME) for a magical world. 

# Assumptions

As magic doesn't exist in the real world and each individual has different ideas about what magic does and how it works a number of assumptions will have to be made.

The core assumption will be based on how common magic is in the world. Further we'll need to decide how magical resources work.

## Rarity of Magic

The idea of a 'low magic' world crops up a lot. 

## Magical Production

Magic is created and refiened by the Spark -- often referring to as a soul. All things have a spark and its size is determined by 3 factors: Age, Gravitas, and Experience. Age, quite simply, refers to a Spark's physical age. The longer a Spark exists, the more it grows. Gravitas represents an object's impact on its surrounding environment. This can sometimes be physical, as in the case of Stars or other celestial phenomena, or emotional, as in the case of a leader's influence. While many creatures and objects' gravitas remains relatively static throughout their lifespan, sapient creatures see fluctuations in their own based on the roles they grow to fill in their societies. This implies that societies greatly impact the growth of magic in both individuals and geographic regions. Finally, Experience refers exclusively to an object's lived and understood experiences. Since only sentient beings can "understand" their experiences, only their Sparks grow from this factor. What experiences result in growth tend to be personal and often dramatic.

The Spark naturally absorbs adjacent ambient magic, filters it, and then releases what is left in a richer, more dense form. While this process seems to defy known laws on the creation of energy, it speaks to a deeper physical law that life refines magic, making it ever more efficient.

The above implies that only life and the processes that are part of it produce magic. This is not true. When an object is destroyed or a creature dies a part of their spark remains. Often referred to as an Anima, this tends to be a base echo of the object or creature (potentially containing a full or partial copy of any memories, personalities, or experiences) and retains the origional spark's ability to absorb and filter ambient magic. The second part, often found only in sapient species is known as the psyche; little is known about it save that it is the full and aware consciousness of a being and that it 'passes on' to an 'afterlife'.

It's important to understand that while all objects and beings have Sparks, not all of them are the same. Each has different qualities or aspects determined by the whole of what it is. This aspect is often referred to as an element, emotion, or magical phenomenon. As an example, a plant might have a nature aspect, a graveyard might have a death aspect, and a dragon might have a life and fire aspect. Which aspects an object or creature has is never set in stone and is determined more by the context in which that object or creature exists, rather than by its type. Thus, not all birds have an air aspect. An exhaustive list of all the aspects, emotions, and phenomena is impossible to create. While a Spark has discrete aspects, the name given to those aspects is as much influenced by how it is perceived as by what it truly is.

This touches on an importand point about how magic is interacted with, a spark's magical nature is, at least in part, influenced by how it is perceived and, further, understood. This

Inanimate (e.g., a rock) ➡️ Autopoietic/Animate Non-Sentient (e.g., a star, or perhaps even a complex robot with self-repairing mechanisms) ➡️ Nociception (e.g., a plant, a jellyfish) ➡️ Sentience (e.g., a dog) ➡️ Sapience (e.g., a human).
