# Roar of the Elder Wyrm (RotEW)

A draw steel campaign based on GW2, but setup as a world of the timescape.

# Prompt for AI to generate the world name.

I want to brainstorm some ideas for names that go beyond simple random name generators. I want to start with a world. It will have a 'true' name given to it by the divinity that created it; but that name won't be widely known, if at all. Other cultures may have a proper name for the world, but most will likely just say "the world".

Vulger Races

Dragon Knight, Memonek, High Elf, Time Raider

Do 4 main towns with ~2 races per.

Dwarf and Orc; Hakaan and Wode Elf; Human and Polder; Revenant and Devil

Of the others: 
- Dragon Knights are rare, mostly all dead; a few remain from a previous war, some are in stasis within 'clutches'.
- Memonek and Time Raiders are both very rare creatures from outside the universe.
- Hgh Elves have closed themselves off from the outside world. Most out and about are in hiding and defing their people's decree.

The world:
300 years ago the powerful Aranian Empire (named after the city of Ara on Orr) was destroyed as Orr was sunk beneath the sea. While much of the imperial territory fell to chaos, the three city states and the Pirate City rose up and reclaimed power.
20 years ago the great dragon Zhaitan awoke from his slumber beneath Orr. He listed the city back above the waves and converted its dead into a mindless army. He seeks to devour the magic of the world. His rise caused a massive tsunami that did extraordinary damage to coastal areas close to Orr. His Risen 'Dead Ships' imposed a strong blockade of the newly risen island nation. Zhaitan's Risen army has been building **slowly**.

What people Know:
They know Orr is risen and of the Tsunami. They do not know about Elder Dragons or the threat they pose.

City- States

Morclach (Great Stone; Dwarven), Tawaskan (The GatheringFlame; Orc), Morkon or Stone Fire (the combination of the two)  -- Dwarf and Orc city, built of an agreement; the Dwarven city of Morlach would be underground and the Orcish trade city of Tawaskan would be above it. The Orcs would sell what the Dwarves built.

Thandoril (Steadfast Warning), called Warning Hall in common -- The Hakaan and Wode Elf city, built at the meeting point of a mountain, forest, and large river. It's less a capital and more a gateway into the world for 2 peoples that are mostly isolated. They came together in a common cause of standing agasint the Aranian Empire. Led by the High Elf general Carasiel. Technically also protects the High Elves, but they're pretty well hidden.

New Fairwyn, formerly Auriolum -- The human and Polder city, once a seat of Aranian power on the continent it gained its independence in the political turmoil that happened just before Orr fell.

The Cities of Second Chance; Sancrist and Graveport -- The freecity of outcasts which is home to Revenants and Devils, but also is the most diverse of the cities. Twin cities, one built at a trades crossroad, the other a nearby port city. The name is also an implicit threat as the saying goes "You only get so many chances." Collectivly refered to as Sancrist
