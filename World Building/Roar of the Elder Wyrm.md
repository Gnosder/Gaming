# Roar of the Elder Wyrm (RotEW)

A draw steel campaign based on GW2, but setup as a world of the timescape.

# Prompt for AI to generate the world name.

I want to brainstorm some ideas for names that go beyond simple random name generators. I want to start with a world. It will have a 'true' name given to it by the divinity that created it; but that name won't be widely known, if at all. Other cultures may have a proper name for the world, but most will likely just say "the world".
