# Roar of the Elder Wyrm (RotEW)

A draw steel campaign based on GW2, but setup as a world of the timescape.

# Prompt for AI to generate the world name.

I want to brainstorm some ideas for names that go beyond simple random name generators. I want to start with a world. It will have a 'true' name given to it by the divinity that created it; but that name won't be widely known, if at all. Other cultures may have a proper name for the world, but most will likely just say "the world".

Do 4 main towns with ~2 races per.

Dwarf and Orc; Hakaan and Wode Elf; Human and Polder; Revenant and Devil

Of the others: 
- Dragon Knights are rare, mostly all dead; a few remain from a previous war, some are in stasis within 'clutches'.
- Memonek and Time Raiders are both very rare creatures from outside the universe.
- Hgh Elves have closed themselves off from the outside world. Most out and about are in hiding and defing their people's decree.

The world:
300 years ago the powerful Aranian Empire (named after the city of Ara on Orr) was destroyed as Orr was sunk beneath the sea. While much of the imperial territory fell to chaos, the three city states and the Pirate City rose up and reclaimed power.
20 years ago the great dragon Zhaitan awoke from his slumber beneath Orr. He listed the city back above the waves and converted its dead into a mindless army. He seeks to devour the magic of the world. His rise caused a massive tsunami that did extraordinary damage to coastal areas close to Orr. His Risen 'Dead Ships' imposed a strong blockade of the newly risen island nation. Zhaitan's Risen army has been building **slowly**.

What people Know:
They know Orr is risen and of the Tsunami. They do not know about Elder Dragons or the threat they pose.

City- States

Morclach (Great Stone; Dwarven), Tawaskan (The GatheringFlame; Orc), Morkan or Stone Fire (the combination of the two)  -- Dwarf and Orc city, built of an agreement; the Dwarven city of Morlach would be underground and the Orcish trade city of Tawaskan would be above it. The Orcs would sell what the Dwarves built.

Thandoril (Steadfast Warning), called Warning Hall in common -- The Hakaan and Wode Elf city, built at the meeting point of a mountain, forest, and large river. It's less a capital and more a gateway into the world for 2 peoples that are mostly isolated. They came together in a common cause of standing agasint the Aranian Empire. Led by the High Elf general Carasiel. Technically also protects the High Elves, but they're pretty well hidden.

New Fairwyn, formerly Auriolum -- The human and Polder city, once a seat of Aranian power on the continent it gained its independence in the political turmoil that happened just before Orr fell.

The Cities of Second Chance; Sancrist and Graveport -- The freecity of outcasts which is home to Revenants and Devils, but also is the most diverse of the cities. Twin cities, one built at a trades crossroad, the other a nearby port city. The name is also an implicit threat as the saying goes "You only get so many chances." Collectivly refered to as Sancrist

The Gods and Races of the world

Human, Dwarf, Orc, Polder, Hakaan, Wode Elf, Revenant, Devil, Dragon Knight, Memonek, High Elf, Time Raider

In fact, first the world was created by the Naru (First Pantheon, made of light and starstuff) who populated it with the Star Elves (who held dominion of the skies), The Giants who controlled the seas, and the Deep Dwarves who ruled the underground places. As magic began to flow into the world natural animals began to mutat and become uplifted (thus were born the Beast-Kin), but the magic began to swell and collect in increasingly fetid pools that spread corruption around the world. To combat this the Naru created the Elder Dragon Suu-won to filter and clean the magic. To help her, Suu-won created the 5 other Elder Dragons; each was tasked with filtering a different type of magic. This plan worked well, at first. The Elder Dragons collected, cleaned, and released the magic back into the world as was intended, but the corruption and pollutants pooled deep within them. Eventually, the Dragons fell to the very corruption they were created to clean. They continued to collect the magic, but they no longer released it back into the world instead becoming consumed by an endless hunger for magic. The Elder races cast down the Dragons -- thinking them destroyed -- and instead turned to other means to filter the wild magics of the world. Not realizing the dragons lived -- though locked in torpor -- the elder races thought their methods effective.

A thousand years after their initial defeat the dragons woke and the world was not prepared for them. In their rage and endless hunger they consumed the magic of the world until it had been reduced to a near barren state. Only a few handfuls of the elder races survived and only by sacrificing their magic. When the world could no longer sate them, the dragons fell back into a long slumber. As the survivors aclimated to their new home, they began to split and devolve. Without magic to sustain their vast, floating cities the Star Elves fell to the earth; some of them chose to embrace their new vantage and became the Wode Elves; others chose to cling to their roots and became the High Elves. Of the Dwarves, there was no sign to those on the surface, but without magic their lives were plunged into darkness and they were beset by the creatures and horrors of the dark. The Giants suffered perhaps the most; without magic they could not live in their ocean homes anymore; their vast cities abandoned, the giants migrated onto land and, finding the woods and plains hostile to them, retreated into the mountains where their lineage bagan to to split with many becoming nothing more than Beastkin.  All the while, agents of the Elder Dragons continued to live and fight on the world, even as their masters slumbered.  Eventually the Dragon scion Glint broke free from Kralkatoric's control and helped the Orcs gain their freedom as well.

As time passed the world healed, magic began to flow back into it and while this return of magic was a good thing the high elves remembered the Dragons and so forged the Bloodstone to collect any magic that was not stricktly needed by the world. The hope was that by keeping the ambient magics low, the dragons would not awaken again or at least be severly weakened.

500 years before the Elder Dragons would wake again the six Gods of man arrived in the world sheparding their Human and Polder followers. They settled on the island of Orr, their initial landing place being consecrated as the Holy City of Arah. As humanity spread around the world, the Gods of Man, unknowing of the Dragons slumbering deep below the earth, ushered a flood of magic into the world as a gift to the races -- who eagerly accepted it, all save the High Elves who feared the return of the Dragons. The High Elves feared the glut of magic unleased by the Gods, but feared too what the Gods would do if they learned of the Dragons; caught between those two fears they were torn on how to react. The great High Elven king decided that they would do nothing and watch while allowing their Bloodstone to continue absorbing magic. The humans eventually learned of the Bloodstone and were enraged, thinking the hauhty high elves were attempting to steal the gift given to all by their Gods. They went to war with the High Elves and, eventually stole the Bloodstone (with help from a cult dedicated to Kralkatoric). A high elf told the Gods about the Dragons before anything was done with the bloodstone. The Gods decided to leave the Bloodstone as it was, much to the dismay of the God Abbadon who attempted to destroy the Bloodstone. The attempt failed as the Bloodstone was broke into 5 pieces instead of fully being destroyed; however the release of magic caused the slumbering elder dragons Jormag and Primodius to awaken and the Gods to retreat from the world after imprisoning Abbadon.

Primodius drove the dwarves out of the deep and into the near surface. Jormag corrupted the giants and forced the Hakaan out of the high mountains. Without the Gods and facing down a wrathful High Elf army a great ritual was enacted to resummon the Gods, but it failed and caused the island of Orr to sink to the bottom of the sea.

Dwarf, Hakaan, High Elf, and Wode Elf were created by the Naruu but were vicimised by Eldar Dragons.
Human and Polder were brought to the world by the six.
Orcs were created by Kralkatoric.
Dragon Knights were created by experiments into Elder Dragons.
Revenants were created by Zhaitan's pressence.
Devil, Memonek, Time Raider come from off world.

# Map Building

The known world is currently just the main continant. (The others were cut off by the waking of the Elder Dragons).

The area has 3 primary regions west, central, and east with sub regions going north, central, and south. 

In the north-west is Vraetho (Crystal Dragon Brand; "Dragon's Embrace"). In the center west is Morkan (made up of Morclach and Tawaskan). In the south-west is The cities of second chance (Sancrist and Graveport). 

In the center north is Zenmar (New Fairwyn). In the center is New Eriess (Coastal Trade Town; was the main hub to Thalorum). In the center south is Thalorum. 

In the north east is Lorenthalas. In the center east is Thandoril. In the South east is the jungle of Maguuma.

Recent cataclysmic events (noteably the great tsunami) have forced sapient races back towards their cultural centers. New Eriess and the Cities of Second Chance were hit the hardest (at least on the main continant).

# The start

[start the map from the first location and build outwards.]

The campaign starts right outside the Cities of Second Chance, in a small (recently formed) archeplago. Called the Shattered Coast. IT was formerly known for it's clay and sand (for cement) exports, but now is known for its exotic fisheries and pearls.
