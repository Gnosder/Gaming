Every world or universe has rules. Here are the rules of the world(s)

Hyperion
  Magic is not common. In mortals it can be learned, but is never inate. There is no difference between Arcane and Divine(it's all magic, just the source can change). However some immortals can grant power.

  Types of life: Mortal, Undead(for mortals), Elemental, Ageless(for mortals), Eternal(for elementals), Immortal

  The northern continent of Hyperion is Adalesca. Frostpunk entering golden age.

    The Currency of Adalesca is the Silver Bit, 11 bits to a Silver Star, 100 SS to a Golden Bar; 7 copper shards to a SB. Some places may use Iron nails, 17 nails to a SB. They use bank notes, but only within certain areas. most places are still coins. On the outskirts/country they may use barter (but should take silver or Iron).
    The largest faction on Adalesca is the Silver Dominion, an industrail frostpunk coalition of city-states entering a golden age.
    Next are the City-states: Elves, Dwarves, Giants, etc
    Finally the Tribes: barbarians, nomads, pirates, etc

# Rules

Mostly OSR; Worlds without Number is a great starting point. Most power is external (magic items, magitech, chemtec etc). Magic is powerful but volitile, risky to use under pressure.

Classes: Expert(Chemtech), Warrior, Mage(Necromancer(balance), Elementalist, Primist), Adventurer (split class; Healer, Shaman, Monk)
Tech: Pre-Industrial, Magic, Magitech, Chemtech

Levels grant HP, stat bonus, Foci/Feature, Skills

Stats:
Body
Mind
Soul
Charisma
Fate

Gain points to spend on Body, Mind, Soul. And bonus points that can be spent on any of them.
Body adds to AC and HP and physical skills
Mind adds to non-combat and non-physical skills
Soul is used to qualify for magic and adds to the magic skills

Charisma is used to find and recurit hirelings
Fate is a measure of luck and importance to the world. It adds to luck rolls and death rolls. At the start of a session the total is of all fates is taken and grants the party fate points equal to that total. Each fate point spent turns into a doom point that the GM can spend. Once spent this way, they are removed until fate is refreshed.

## Magic

Volitile, dangerous to the user as well as the targets.
Each mage can cast a number of spells per day as shown on their chart. They may attempt to cast more, but there is an ever increasing risk with each casting. A magic roll is made against a DC of 14 with +2 per roll made in the day. On a success the spell is cast as normal. On a failure, compare the roll to the DC and consulte the following table.

Magical Mishap (Winds of Magic)
Difference | Effect
1-2 | The spell is cast twice and the second spell has a random target as chosen by the GM.
3-5 | The spell is cast, but the caster suffers the effects of the spell at 1/2 power or duration.
6-9 | The spell is not cast and the caster loses HP equal to 5 times the level of the spell.
9+  | The spell is not cast and the caster can't cast spells for 1d4 days.
