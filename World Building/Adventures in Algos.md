# Adventures in Algos

This doc will have a high level view of major adventures. Many will be level locked. I.e. above a certain level they have already been resolved (one way or another). Stories are either - Core, supplimental, or ad hoc

## Adventure Types and Tags

Stories can be classed as one of the following:
- Core
- Supplimental
- Ad hoc

Core: is required to progress to the next step of a larger story. These are the primary way to progress and have the best rewards.

Supplimental: also known as a *side quest* is a short adventure. These can be related to a core story or stand alone. Rewards tend to be less than Core and are more likely to be cash or goods. Can also reward specific items.

Ad Hoc: An improvised adventure or vingette. These are almost always stand alone and tend to reward only consumable items. An ad hoc story can also be in search of a single specific thing (item). I.e. if you are looking for a holy avenger, this might be an ad hoc story. However finding an artifact might be a core story.
