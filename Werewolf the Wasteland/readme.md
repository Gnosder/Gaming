# Werewolf the Wasteland Readme

A game written by Gnosder.

A mash-up of Werewolf the Apocolypse, Mad Max, and Final Fantasy X.

The game is set in the wasteland of Austrailia after a global calamity shattered the barrier between the real and spirit worlds. Humanity attempted to defend itself. Through nuclear weapons they were able to poison the "no land" between the two worlds but plunged themselves into a dark age. The werewolves, the traditional guadians of the veil, were almost complelty wiped out in the fighting, having been caught between the two warring factions (Human and Spirit).
