# Building A Curiculum

1. Figure out how long the school year is as well as each divion.

i.e. How long is semester 1 and how long is semester 2. Where are the holidays? Which of the weeks are incomplete.

Break each unit into Lessons, Review, and Assessment. It should be broken up by sub standards where each substandard is ~5 days. Given ~36 5 days weeks gives a possible 36 sub units. Some full review blocks should be added in. Alternativly, each sub unit takes as long as it takes and is broken up in blocks.
