## Classwork

Classwork cannot be made up (as it can only be done in class on the day it is given), however if you have an **excused** absence then you will be given full points for classwork that day.

### Rubric (8 points max)

Digital homework (done on a computer) will be graded based on the posted rubric for that assignment or tool.

\* Homework is considered turned in if it **at least** has your name on it.

## Make-up Homework

Homework will be collected and graded the day it is due. Late homework can be turned in at any time before the last week of the **semester** for a maximum score of a B.

## Testing and Assessments

There are 3 main types of tests and assessments.

*Quiz:* These will usually be given out weekly during a unit. All quizes are **open note**, however they cannot be retaken.

*Projects:* These will be multi-day assignments and **must** be turned in on their due date. If you are absent on the date a project is due, you will have 2 days from the day you get back to turn it in, otherwise it will be marked late. Late projects cannot receive a grade higher than a B. A late project can be turned in for credit up until the last week of school.

*Test:* A test will usually be given out at the end of each unit. **These will be the largest part of your grade,** so take them seriously. Tests can be retaken an unlimited number of times (see the make-up and retake policy below).

## Make-up Tests and Retakes

If you are absent and unable to take a test, you are responsible for getting it done. See retakes to learn how to make-up a test.

With very few exceptions you will be able to retake a test an unlimited number of times. Your highest grade will always be used. In order to retake, you must do so before school, after school, or during lunch either in my classroom or the math tutoring center.

## Extra Credit

You will have plenty of options for extra credit throughout the class.

## FAQ

### How hard is this class?

Simple answer? The class is as hard as you make it.

Complex answer? What do you consider to be hard?

### How can I pass the class?

Pay attention. Take notes. Do your homework.

The grade you get will reflect the effort you put into the class.

### How much will ______ affect my grade?

TODO

### Do I have to keep my notes?

**Yes!** You will lose points if you do not have your notes.

### What does a normal week look like?

In general, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday will be learning new material. Thursday will be *either* review or test depending on class grades from Mon-Wed. Friday will *either* be test day or fun day depending on what was done on thursday.

### We have fun days? Will they actually be fun?

Yes we do have fun days and I do hope you will find them to be fun.

### How do fun days work and how do we earn them?

You **earn** fun days by having a class average of at least a B- from Monday to Wednesday of that week. When you earn a fun day we will **skip** review on thursday and 
have the test instead, which will leave Friday free for us to have fun.

On a fun day, we will explore new ideas, learn new things, and just decompress from the trials of the week.
