# Wildcard

## Introduction

Wildcard is a system replacement and suppliment for ttrpgs. The purpose of Wildcard is to expand the mechanical abilities of ttrpgs without adding too much 'bloat'. Most of the Wildcard rules are GM facing.

## Overview

### The Fate Deck

WIldcard replaces the dice rolling of traditional ttrpgs with a deck of cards called the Fate Deck. Whenever a player would roll a die they instead draw a card from the Fate Deck. The Fate Deck cards are valued from 1-20 (for d20 base systems) the deck also cointains a joker, 1 for every full set of cards (i.e. for every 20 there is 1 joker). Cards also have a suit: Doom, Destiny, Law, Chaos. The fate deck is shuffled at the start of each session and each scene as well as when it runs out. All participants in a scene draw from the same deck.

### The Wild Deck

There is a second deck of cards that are given out to characters as boons/rewards/inspiration/etc. These cards tend to have values of 15+ and can impart special effects. A player may replace any 1 drawn card with a Wild card, this discards the wild card. The Wild Deck is suffled at the start of each session or when it runs out of cards. By default, a player may have no more than 2 wild cards at any given time.

## Checks

Making ability checks, saving throws, et. all, works mostly the same as before. Flip a card, add bonuses and penalties to it and then compare the result to a DC/TN.
    If, for example, you have advantage you would draw 2 cards and choose the highest.
If you have a wild card you may replace your card with it. You may use only 1 wild card per check, regardless of how many cards you draw.
After the check all cards used are discarded in their appropriate place (fate cards in the fate discard, wild cards in the wild discard).

## Standoff

A standoff is a conflict between 2 or more parties that has not yet come to blows (physical or otherwise). Standoff's escalate and set the consequences for the conflict. The rules for a standoff are pretty straight forward. A standoff is played out as a simplified version of poker. Cards are dealt to each participant

Each party is dealt 2 cards to form their hand. They can look at their hand and should keep it secret from their opponents. Skills don't factor into a standoff, it's a game of chicken.
Starting with the party that began the conflict by saying 'no' or 'putting up a wall' they decide whether to call, raise, or fold.

    Call: Passes play to the next party who may then call, raise, or fold. If all parties call in the same round, the conflict resolves.
    Raise: A new card is dealt to the party. This escalates the conflict, raising the consequences.
    Fold: A party chooses to bow out of the conflict and ceed defeat. Following one party folding, the others must also fold (thus agreeing to end the conflict), if they do not all folds are counted as call for the round. When a party folds they suffer no consequences, but must give over the stakes of the conflict.

Once all parties have called the conflict resolves. To resolve a conflict each participant adds their cards together and reveals the result. The party with the highest result is the winner and the party with the lowest is the loser. 
A party may use up to 2 wild cards to replace cards in their result.

### Escalation and Consequences

As the number of cards held in a standoff increases so too do the potential consequences the loser suffers. The escalation levels and consequences are thus (the level is equal to the lowest number of cards held by a party):

    Level 2: Simple consequences; might result in a minor complication
    Level 3: 'Standard' consequences; usually results in a minor complication and, if combat follows, allows the winner to act first.
    Level 4: High consequences; always results in a complication (minor or major) and the winner automatically deals lethal damage to the loser. In addition the winner acts first in the ensuing combat.
    Level 5: Lethal consequences; Crimes of passion or intent, the loser dies. (Note that this may leave the overall conflict unresolved)

#### Complications

Complications exist in addition to the binary nature of HP (dead or not dead) and represent injuries that impart penalties. Complications may be physical, emotional, or social and are broken up into 4 catagories.

    Minor: small annoyances that recover quickly (brusies to body or ego, for example). They tend to impart minor penalties to specific checks (e.g. -1 when using this pot to cook)
    Major: Lasting and painful consquences, they tend to last from 1 to several sessions and impart minor universal penalties or major specific penalties. (e.g. -2 to social checks in town or -8 to diplomacy with the Diamond Brotherhood)
    Severe: Debilitating injuries and consequences that typically remove characters from play for extended periods of time. These consequences usually take months to heal and months more of work or rehab to fully recover if they ever do.
    Scar: Scars are severe consquences that have healed and,contrary to the nature of other complications, can grant bonuses as well as penalties. Scars can represent lingering injury or disability as well as learned lessons and wisdom. (Scars that don't have a bonus will typically grant XP)

##### Complications and Healing

Complications tend to recover at a rate of 1-4 hours for minor, 1 - 4 weeks for major, 1-4 years for severe, but can be healed faster with appropriate care.

For phsyical consequences:
With medical treatment a complication can heal 25% faster, with bedrest and constant treatment they can heal 50% faster. Magical healing can rapiddly remove consequences. When receiving magical healing, a consequence may be reduced by 1 level of severity if the target is already at full HP. A consequence can only be lowered by one level in this way, unless a spell specifies otherwise.
    >TODO: or something someting 25% max hp (scale?)
An exception to this is minor consequences which disappear after receiving any magical healing.
