# Wildcard

## Introduction

Wildcard is a system replacement and suppliment for ttrpgs. The purpose of Wildcard is to expand the mechanical abilities of ttrpgs without adding too much 'bloat'. Most of the Wildcard rules are GM facing.

## Overview

### The Fate Deck

WIldcard replaces the dice rolling of traditional ttrpgs with a deck of cards called the Fate Deck. Whenever a player would roll a die they instead draw a card from the Fate Deck. The Fate Deck cards are valued from 1-20 (for d20 base systems) the deck also cointains a joker, 1 for every full set of cards (i.e. for every 20 there is 1 joker). Cards also have a suit: Doom, Destiny, Law, Chaos. The fate deck is suffled at the start of each session and each scene as well as when it runs out. All participants in a scene draw from the same deck.

### The Wild Deck

There is a second deck of cards that are given out to characters as boons/rewards/inspiration/etc. These cards tend to have values of 15+ and can impart special effects. A player may replace any 1 drawn card with a Wild card, this discards the wild card. The Wild Deck is suffled at the start of each session or when it runs out of cards. By default, a player may have no more than 2 wild cards at any given time.

## Standoff

A standoff is a conflict between 2 or more parties that has not yet come to blows (physical or otherwise). Standoff's escalate and set the consequences for the conflict. The rules for a standoff are pretty straight forward. A standoff is played out as a simplified version of poker. Cards are dealt to each participant

Each party is dealt 2 cards to form their hand. They can look at their hand and should keep it secret from their opponents.
Starting with the party that began the conflict by saying 'no' or 'putting up a wall' they decide whether to call, raise, or fold.

    Call: Passes play to the next party who may then call, raise, or fold. If all parties call in the same round, the conflict resolves.
    Raise: A new card is dealt to the party. This escalates the conflict, raising the consequences.
    Fold: A party chooses to bow out of the conflict and ceed defeat. Following one party folding, the others must also fold (thus agreeing to end the conflict), if they do not all folds are counted as call for the round. When a party folds they suffer no consequences, but must give over the stakes of the conflict.
