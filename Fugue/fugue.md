# Fugue

Fugue is a game built by Gnosder that follows these prinicples:
 1) Just Play!
 2) Rigor is nice, but so is playing the game

The game has 2 play "modes": Quick and Crunch

Quick refers to being able to build characters on the fly and drop into game, this requires high GM game knowledge.
Crunch refers to a slower and more methodical start to the game where bonuses are more nuanced.
Both modes are compatible. Crunch will be more versatile and nuanced, but Quick will still be on par (ish).

## Just Play

There are a few barriors between the decision to play a game and to actually play it. With board games those are: learning the rules and setting up the game (also unboxing the game if it's new). For a roleplaying game those are: Learning the rules (GM), learning the rules (Player), Building characters (player), writing an adventure/session (GM).

The Quick mode removes the responisbilities of the players, but places more responsibility on the GM. Thus the barriors for Quick look like: Learn the rules (GM), learn the Quick rules(GM), write an adventure/session (GM). This mode, while ultimatley unfair to the GM, allows the players -- who may or may not be new to the hobby -- the ability to jump straight into the game without sacrificing anything.

## The Flow of Roleplaying Games

In order to understand how quick mode works you must first understand how games are typically run.

A campaign (the totality of the game) is broken into adventures (contiguous snipets of the game), which are played out in sessions (the time the game is actually played at the table), which can be further subdivided into scenes (consecutive moments of gameplay) and then encounters (discreet challenges within a scene). While othersubdivisions exist (e.g. montage) this break down is sufficient for the current purpose.

While every beat within a session follows the same format it is useful to examine it at the encounter level with an example:
    (Example 1.1)
    GM: The goblin charges towards Pike. Its sholder lowered and violence in its eyes. What does Pike do?
    Pike: I brace myself against the charge and attempt to absorb it.
    GM: That will give you a bonus on your defence. The goblin rolls 16 for its charge, with a +2 bonus to your defence does it hit you?
    Pike: Even with the bonus I'm still only at a 15, so yes.
    GM: The Goblin slams into Pike, bowling him over to the ground. Pike takes 5 damage. 
    GM: June, you've just seen Pike get knocked over and the goblin's ally aims its crossbow at you, what do you do?

This example shows the basic structure of role playing games which is: Narrate and prompt, Declare and adjudicate, Narrate and repeat.
    Narrate: The GM describes the current scene, action, effect, etc. in the context of the game.
    Prompt: The GM asks the player to act.
    Declare: The player declares the action they would like to take.
    Adjudicate: A process where the GM translates the declared action of the player into the needed mechanics and resolves those mechanics.
    Repeat: means simple that the structure is repeated.

Adjudicate is the part worth partially exploring right now it will be covered in more detail later. When a GM adjudicates an action they first: make sure they know what the player INTENDS and may need to question the player to learn that (see example 1.2 below). Then they decide what game mechanics that action requires. Then they resolve those mechanics. Finally they interpret the results. Example 1.3 below.

    (Example 1.2)
    Pike: I want to brace myself against the charge.
    GM: What are you trying to accomplish? It sounds like you want it to hit you, but you're trying to prevent it from effecting you, yes?
    Pike: Yeah, I think it's going to try and tackle me or knock me over so I want to make it harder for it to do that.
    GM: Ok, this will give you a bonus to your defense, but it will count as your reaction for the round. Is that ok?
    Pike: Yes.
    GM: The goblin rolls 16 for its charge, with a +2 bonus to your defence does it hit you?
    Pike: Even with the bonus I'm still only at a 15, so yes.

    (Example 1.3)
    Pike: I brace myself against the charge and attempt to absorb it.
    GM: (To self) That is a reaction, which he still has available for the round, and grants a +2 on the next attack action made against him. The Goblin has a +1 to hit bonus and rolled a 15.
    GM: That will give you a bonus on your defence. The goblin rolls 16 for its charge, with a +2 bonus to your defence does it hit you?
    Pike: Even with the bonus I'm still only at a 15, so yes.

## Quick Mode -- Flow of the Game

Quick mode follows the same format as above however it modifies the adjudicate step. In a more standard game the player has a character sheet which lists their characteristics. However, with the quick mode they may not. They may need to construct their character on the fly (EX 1.4).

    (Example 1.4)
    GM: The goblin charges towards Pike. Its sholder lowered and violence in its eyes. What does Pike do?
    Pike: I want brace myself against the charge and attempt to absorb it.
    GM: How good is Pike at defending against something like this? He's a wizard right?
    Pike: He is, but I think he spent some time at least playing sports or something (do they have those here?) so he should be pretty good at it.
    GM: Sounds like he would be above-average at it, he would havea base of 13 to defend against this and his defensive action will give him a +2. Does that sound good?
    Pike: Yeah, I think that sounds fair.
    GM: Ok, mark your defense as being 13. The goblin rolls 16 for its charge, with a +2 bonus to your defence does it hit you?
    Pike: Even with the bonus I'm still only at a 15, so yes.
    GM: The Goblin slams into Pike, bowling him over to the ground. Pike takes 5 damage.

Notice that while the action was being adjudicated the GM had to help Pike's player determine some of Pike's statistics. This is where the quick rules come into effect
