# Modular Inventory, Equipment, and Supplies

The purpose of thi document is to have several modular systems that can be inserted into any game.

I want encumbrance (complex, simple),and wealth systems (RAW and Abstracted).

## Encumbrance

Tracking encumbrace sucks. No one likes to do it, but when it is relevant then it must be done

### Complex Encumbrance System



### Simple Encumbrance System


### Bulk

### Supply

A rather simple idea to defeat massive inventories and shopping trips.

A character buys and carries a general item called supply. They can expend that supply as an exploration move to 'purchase' an item off the supply list. There are limits, however. A character may purchasae a recharge or refill of an item they already brought for its normal supply value. If you wish to get an item you did not bring, you can, but, you roll a d6 with it. The item costs extra supply equal to the roll or the cost of the item, which ever is lower.
