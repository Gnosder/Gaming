# TODO and notes 25/25/9

Get a day planner for lesson tracking. A course planner. (It should have room for each course/ different class).

Ask students where their notes are. Make them bring their notes and make them draw pictures.

Mathmedic is 'weird' in relation to how they have some lessons listed.

For the probability lessons bring in dice.

# Daily Plan

**The Plan** A high level summary of the lesson.

**Standards**

*Goal:* What standards do you want to hit.

*Differentintation:* Who are you changing it for and what do you need to change?

*Application of Theory:* (Behaviorism, Cognitivism, Constructivism, Social Learning Theory, Humanism)

**T+0 | The Bell**

*Goal* Settle students and activate prior knowledge.

*Students will* be in their seats, have their phones away, and work on the Bell Ringer.

**T+5 | "I do" part 1**

*Goal* Introduce the first core concept.

*Activity* Lecture or video clip.

*I will:* Students will complete the activity.

*Students will:* Students will actively listen and take notes.

**T+10 | "We do" part 1**

*Goal:* Practice the first concept with guidance.

*Activity:* "Think-Pair-Share" or a class poll on the concept.

*I will:* Observe and correct

*Students will:* Students will complete the activity.

*I will:* Observe and Correct; attend the activity.

*Student's will:* Engage with and attent to the activity.

**T+45 | Wrap-up**

*Goal:* Review and check for understanding of both concepts.

*Activity:* A final "Exit Ticket" or a brief summary of the two main ideas.

**Final notes:**

Remember, this is a flexible template. Adjust it as needed to meet the specific needs of your class

A common variation will be having a single one of each segment ("I do" at T+5; "We do" at T+10; "You do" at T+20).

The activity listed is mearly a suggestion and a default when nothing else will work. They can and should be replaced as needed.

# Reflection

**How did it go?**

**How was your time?**

**What could have been done better?**

# Sample activity bank


## Bell Ringer

**"Do Now"** 1-3 questions on the board that reviews a previous concept or introduces the new one.

**Quick Write** A short prompt for students to write.

**Tech Ringer** A short kahoots quiz or some other online application.

## I do

**Mini Lecture** A traditional teacher-led explanation, but kept to a shorter, digestible length.

**Video clip with questions** Show a short video (3-5 minutes) and provide a guiding question for students to answer.

**Guided Reading** Read a passage aloud together and stop to ask clarifying questions. Feel free to combine with the "We do" section.

## We do

**Think-Pair-Share** Pose a question, students think individually, discuss with a partner, and then share with the class.

**Class Poll** Ask a series of true/false or agree/disagree questions to gauge understanding.

**Collaborative Problem Solving** Present a problem for students to work on together in small groups.

**Gallery Walk** After students have worked in groups on a problem or project, have them tape their work on the wall. The whole class can then walk around like they're in a gallery, observing and commenting on each other's work with sticky notes. 

## You do

**Jigsaw Activity**	Break the content into pieces. Assign each group one piece to become an "expert" on, then have them teach their piece to the other groups. Might take multiple "You do" slots and/or take multiple periods.

**Lab/Hands-On Activity** A science experiment, an art project, or building a model.

**Small Group Discussion**	Give groups a set of discussion questions to work through on their own.

**Writing Prompt**	Give students a prompt and have them write independently.

## Wrap up

**Exit Ticket** A single question on a notecard that they must answer before they leave.

**One-minute Summary** Have a student or a group summarize the key takeaways of the lesson in one minute.

**Parking Lot** Students write a question they still have, or something they learned. Can be a board via sticky notes or online via a form.

**Tech Closer** A short kahoots quiz or some other online application.

# Educational Learning Theories

* **Behaviorism:** This theory focuses on observable behaviors and the idea that learning is a response to stimuli. In practice, this might involve using positive or negative reinforcement (e.g., rewards for good behavior, points for completing tasks).
* **Cognitivism:** This theory looks at the internal mental processes of learning, such as memory, problem-solving, and thinking. Applying this theory involves activities that engage students in active problem-solving and critical thinking, helping them to organize and connect new information with what they already know. Examples include graphic organizers, Socratic seminars, and making connections between concepts.
* **Constructivism:** This is a very popular theory in modern education. It is based on the idea that learners actively "construct" their own knowledge and understanding of the world through experiencing things and reflecting on those experiences. In a constructivist classroom, the teacher acts as a facilitator, and students are encouraged to engage in hands-on projects, group collaborations, and self-directed learning.
* **Social Learning Theory:** This theory, championed by Albert Bandura, emphasizes that people learn by observing others. Its application in the classroom involves modeling desired behaviors, encouraging collaboration, and using group work to promote learning through social interaction.
* **Humanism:** This theory focuses on the whole person, including emotional well-being and personal growth. A humanistic approach to teaching prioritizes student choice, intrinsic motivation, and creating a supportive, nurturing environment where students feel safe to explore their potential.
