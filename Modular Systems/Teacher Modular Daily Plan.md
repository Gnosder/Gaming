**Final notes:**

Remember, this is a flexible template. Adjust it as needed to meet the specific needs of your class

A common variation will be having a single one of each segment ("I do" at T+5; "We do" at T+10; "You do" at T+20).

The activity listed is mearly a suggestion and a default when nothing else will work. They can and should be replaced as needed.

# Sample activity bank


## Bell Ringer

**"Do Now"** 1-3 questions on the board that reviews a previous concept or introduces the new one.

**Quick Write** A short prompt for students to write.

**Tech Ringer** A short kahoots quiz or some other online application.

## I do

**Mini Lecture** A traditional teacher-led explanation, but kept to a shorter, digestible length.

**Video clip with questions** Show a short video (3-5 minutes) and provide a guiding question for students to answer.

**Guided Reading** Read a passage aloud together and stop to ask clarifying questions. Feel free to combine with the "We do" section.

## We do

**Think-Pair-Share** Pose a question, students think individually, discuss with a partner, and then share with the class.

**Class Poll** Ask a series of true/false or agree/disagree questions to gauge understanding.

**Collaborative Problem Solving** Present a problem for students to work on together in small groups.

**Gallery Walk** After students have worked in groups on a problem or project, have them tape their work on the wall. The whole class can then walk around like they're in a gallery, observing and commenting on each other's work with sticky notes. 

## You do

**Jigsaw Activity**	Break the content into pieces. Assign each group one piece to become an "expert" on, then have them teach their piece to the other groups. Might take multiple "You do" slots and/or take multiple periods.

**Lab/Hands-On Activity** A science experiment, an art project, or building a model.

**Small Group Discussion**	Give groups a set of discussion questions to work through on their own.

**Writing Prompt**	Give students a prompt and have them write independently.
