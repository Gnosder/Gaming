# Modular Magic

A drag and drop magic system that can be added to *most* games.

# Ideas

Item based magic. Uses explicit and/or general reagents.
    - Common, Uncommon, and Rare reagents (Levels 1-3, 4-6, 7-9)
    - Common can be purchased with SUPPLY
    - Common ritual magic doesn't require reagents, but it makes it stronger and can increase it's potency to higher tiers.
    - Higer tier ritual magic does equire reagents, higher level reagents increase it's potency.

Learn Spells based on criteria (skill, level, etc.) and as per tradition.


Noods 25/25/9 --
    I keep coming back to the idea that classes are custum and made up of Origin, Archtype, Powersource.
    One important thing is that all archtypes should do damage while performing their role:
        - Tanks should taunt as part of dealing damage
        - Healers should heal as part of dealing damage
    The choice should never be between damage and role it should be about which cool action should I take now.
    The problem of item based magic... if you carry a ton of reagents you can cast a ton of spells. If you fill a retainer's inventory with reagents then you can continuously cast spells. Direct attack magic should be rare/volitile/the same as a martial. This means magic is about control (buff, debuff, etc.). It also means reagents can be used as ammo.
    Yeah, Reagents are ammo. Spells can only be learned by a specific few, but anyone can use a magic item (if they have enough ammo for it).
    Using draw steel as a base: Origin gives you skills and abilities. Archtype gives abilities including Heroic actions and a resource spender. Powertype gives a resource, abilities, including heroic action and a resource spender, and skills.

Origin
    - Ancestry
        Perks
    - Culture
        Skills, Language
    - Background
        Skills, Language, Ability, Wealth, Renown
Archtype
    - Role (Striker, Defender, Controller, Leader)
    - Kit 
    - Camp Ability (Guard, Expert, Explorer)
Powersource
    - Source
    - Resource Builder

Abilities have a base form and are modified by Role and Source.
Resource builder will have a start of turn, reaction, and out of combat. Reaction will be determined by chosen role.

Deathspiral is bad, but an inverse death spiral is... good? Probably just for Heroes and Villans. Chaff wont get it. Health system is physical and stun. Physical is split into 'stamina' and 'wounds' where at 50% they become winded and start taking meat damage. Stun, when filled imposes conditions and reduces defense. What if defense is increased by wounds? Health is increased by 2 at a time, one stamina and one wound. Perhaps change the name from wound to flesh? What if it was relatd to duusk bastards. Shouldn't be too abstracted (like, Dusk and Midnight) maybe Stress and Flesh?

Defense and Health go together. Attacks should always deal damage, deals effects based on potency. Stun or Phys based on if damage is > armor. GM says "You take 14 damagae" and then the character decides if it does phys or stun. That breaks with any kind of level scaling on damage... though scale based on size is good. (Attribute + Armor + Level). Armor can be damaged to have an attack deal stun. Character sheet: (standard page is 8.5" by ll", minus margins of 1/2" leaves 7.5" ad 10"; break that into a 1/2" grid leaves 15x20; 3 Sections across and 4 sections down) 3x1 for General and Bio info, 3x1 for attriutes, 1x2 for attacks, 1x2 for skills and feats, 1x2 for defense.

Recoveries can recover stun, stress or flesh in any combination, however they cannot recover wounds. A 20 minute rest will recover stress and stun. Flesh can be restored with a recovery. Clear instead of recover.
