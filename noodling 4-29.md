A game that combines ICRPG (Indedx card RPG) with WwN(Worlds without number)

I like ICRPG (hence after IC) in most cases. I want players to roll def against attacks rather than attacks against them. I like the effort rules and dice. Loot is cool. Mastery is fun (what if a nat 20 was bonus xp?) maybe second track?

From WwN, I really like shock value (dmg on miss). Mixed classes. System Strain (stress).  Readied items vs stowed (slots)

I still like consequences

HP -> Stress and consequences
    An HP value either flat or by class (OSR)
    2 Mild, 1 Moderate, 1 Severe consequence
        Each one has a value (25%, 50%, 100%) of stress that it absorbs

Blessings, Curses, Scars

Bane and Boon/ Doom and Destiny

Supply(SUP)
Each character can carry a number of supplies equal to their Int score. Supplies are generic/catch all items.
