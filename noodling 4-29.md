A game that combines ICRPG (Indedx card RPG) with WwN(Worlds without number)

I like ICRPG (hence after IC) in most cases. I want players to roll def against attacks rather than attacks against them. I like the effort rules and dice. Loot is cool. Mastery is fun (what if a nat 20 was bonus xp?) maybe second track?

From WwN, I really like shock value (dmg on miss). Mixed classes. System Strain (stress).  Readied items vs stowed (slots)

I still like consequences

HP -> Stress and consequences
    An HP value either flat or by class (OSR)
    2 Mild, 1 Moderate, 1 Severe consequence
        Each one has a value (25%, 50%, 100%) of stress that it absorbs

Blessings, Curses, Scars

Bane and Boon/ Doom and Destiny

Supply(SUP)
Each character can carry a number of supplies equal to their Int score. Supplies are generic/catch all items, but can only be used to replinish something explicitly brought. Omni-Supplies can be used to gain any supply.

Bonus at high levels
MIGHT -- Melee Attack, combat prowess: +3 Item Slots
AGILITY -- Dodge, Ranged Attack, skirmishing: Take Priority for free
BODY -- HP, Fortitude: +1 Minor Consequence
WIT -- Perception, Supply: 4 Omni Supply
ARCANE -- Magic: +1 MP
POISE -- Willpower, Charisma: +Status?

AP Action Points
    Each round a character has 3(?) AP. AP can be spent to do things in the round.
    Common Actions: Attack, Move, Cast a Spell, Full Defense, etc. Common actions take AP.
    Interupt Actions: Disrupt, AOO, Take Priority, Scramble
    Defensive Actions: Dodge, Block, Parry

Initiative: Rounds move in reverse order, characters with a higher initiative may use the Take Priority Action to take their turn before someone else. (Going last is better as it lets you react, you can 'preempt' by taking the "Take Priority" action)

Use Shadow of the Demon Lord's boon dice system. +d6 for each boon, -d6 for each curse. They cancel out 1 for 1 and only the best die counts. Roll Effort on pass.

On a miss; deal effort equal to stat. Crits deal max effort and mark off a consequence if possible or double damage if not.
Crit miss; deal no effort and suffer drawback (something like, -2 ongoing, spend an AP to reset)

Defenses:
    Armor - DEF equal AC + BODY
    Dodge - Def equal AGILITY + WIT
    Parry - Def eqaul skill + Might
    Magic Save - ARCANE + POISE

    Some attacks negate certain defenses. E.G. Dragon Fire can't be parried.
