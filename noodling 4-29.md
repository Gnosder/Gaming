A game that combines ICRPG (Indedx card RPG) with WwN(Worlds without number)

I like ICRPG (hence after IC) in most cases. I want players to roll def against attacks rather than attacks against them. I like the effort rules and dice. Loot is cool. Mastery is fun (what if a nat 20 was bonus xp?) maybe second track?

From WwN, I really like shock value (dmg on miss). Mixed classes. System Strain (stress).  Readied items vs stowed (slots)

I still like consequences

HP -> Stress and consequences
    An HP value either flat or by class (OSR)
    2 Mild, 1 Moderate, 1 Severe consequence
        Each one has a value (25%, 50%, 100%) of stress that it absorbs

Blessings, Curses, Scars

Bane and Boon/ Doom and Destiny

Supply(SUP)
Each character can carry a number of supplies equal to their Int score. Supplies are generic/catch all items, but can only be used to replinish something explicitly brought. Omni-Supplies can be used to gain any supply.

Bonus at high levels
MIGHT -- Melee Attack, combat prowess: +3 Item Slots
AGILITY -- Dodge, Ranged Attack, skirmishing: Take Priority for free
BODY -- HP, Fortitude: +1 Minor Consequence
WIT -- Perception, Supply: 4 Omni Supply
ARCANE -- Magic: +1 MP
POISE -- Willpower, Charisma: +Status?

AP Action Points
    Each round a character has 3(?) AP. AP can be spent to do things in the round.
    Common Actions: Attack, Move, Cast a Spell, Guard, Protect Other
        Guard: Spend 1 AP to gain boon on defense rolls until next turn
        Protect Other: Spend 1 AP to be able to defend a nearby ally attacks. The first defense is free.
    Interupt Actions: AOO, Take Priority, Scramble, Hold
        AoO: Spend 1 AP if an enemy you are engaged with moves away, casts a spell, or attacks another target to make a weapon attack with 1 bane. IF target is casting a spell, effort rolled is subtracted from spell roll.
        Take Priority: Spend 1 AP to Act sooner in round
        Scramble: Spend 1 AP to move 5ft
        Hold: Spend 1 AP to hold action until later in round
    Defensive Actions: Dodge, Block, Parry, Full Defense
        All defensive actions share repeating action costs
        Full Defense costs 2 AP, can roll defense against all incoming attacks, cannot make attacks or cast spells
    Repeating actions in a round cost +1 AP.

Initiative: Characters with a lower initiative may use the Take Priority Action to take their turn before someone else.

Use Shadow of the Demon Lord's boon dice system. +d6 for each boon, -d6 for each curse. They cancel out 1 for 1 and only the best die counts. Roll Effort on pass.

On a miss; deal effort equal to stat. Crits deal normal effort plus ultimate effort.
Crit miss; deal no effort and suffer drawback (something like, -2 ongoing, spend an AP to reset)

Defenses:
    Armor - DEF equal AC + BODY
    Dodge - Def equal AGILITY + WIT
    Parry - Def eqaul skill + Might
    Magic Save - ARCANE + POISE

    Some attacks negate certain defenses. E.G. Dragon Fire can't be parried.
