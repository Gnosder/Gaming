Warder Nek easily lead the lightborn out of Yalt, but in the process...
"While picking your way out of the petrifed jungle of Yalt, you emerge into a large clearing. In its center is one of the largest trees you've ever seen, easily 80ft around and several hundred feet tall, streaching far above the other tree tops. It is petrified like the rest of Yalt, and on its trunk you see what appear to be small petrified doorways leading deeper into the tree."
    The petrified life tree was once home to a large colony of pixies, but most were killed when Yalt fell. If the Lightborn can enter the tree, they find little of value that isn't just as ruined as the rest of Yalt and then only if they like cultural artefacts of the pixies.

Once out of Yalt...
"As you reach the border of Yalt, the petrified trees slowly give way to green shrubs and then into lush fronds. You've reached the Crystal Shores. Warder Nek points west, "That way leads to the ever shifting sands of Nebaimos, to the east is the Crystal Sea and the Lush Archepalago. To the south, where we're going, is the Grand Alliance of Alexander. We'll soon pass near to a House Garlemald fort and then from we'll turn onto a road and be clear all the way to Alexander."

The fort is a tall and thin watch tower, it houses a small garrison of 5 soldiers. They show little intrest in the Lightborn and Warder Nek. They aren't fully alert. They're keeping an eye on Yalt (making sure the dead there stay there> as well as watching over a small cave within eye sight of the tower. The cave is an entrance to the deep dark and was once favored by raiders.
The tower connects to a road which winds its way to the south and east (to the Holdfast of Swallow Bay and, eventually, the holdfast of Port Honest). Once on the road Warder Nek is able to increase the pace and they make good time, arriving at Alexander around 4.

"You crest a small hill and see that a 'scenic overlook' has been constructed there. A few stone benches and shade. The view is far more spectacular than the oeverlook suggests. In the distance you see the upper torso of a massive construct, Alexander, it is thick and built like a hero. Even at this range you can see that it is easily 400 feet tall and you can only see its from the waist up, with the rest burried below the surface. Around Alexander you see several impressive palaces full of soaring buttresses and waving penants. Built around there is a dense city, its wildly varying archectures foreshadow a large diaspora of races and cultures. "That's the Grand Alliance of Alexander. 13 noble houses working together for the common good. Or so the story goes, in truth it's far from a paradise and the politics are much more petty than one would hope, but thankfully they're removed from the common man. It's a good place to live, all things considered. Especially in this day." Warder Nek's voice grew grim at the last, but he still favors the city with a hopeful grin."
"We'll enter the city proper through the gates of Garlemald, where this road leads. From there we'll move into the Doma district to find the secret entrance to the Warder Circle. The speaker will be waiting for us there."

The Gates of Garlemald are majestic, clearly showing off the imperial roman flair which they favor. Guards in gleaming Golden-bronze armor stand at attention, their brilliant white cloaks waving slowly in a small breeze. As you enter the gates no one stops you or asks your business, the Grand Alliance of Alexander is open to all. The streets themselves are made of well laid cobblestones with packed earth gutters at their edge. A thin, well used cart path runs along its center. People of all varieties and races stroll along, leasurly going about their days, interspersed between them, you see people of military bearing in well starched and snug uniforms -- an uncommon sight outside of military acadamies, and then only amongs the most noble.

Warder Nek allows the Lightborn the freedom to explore at their whim and acts the part of a knowledgeable tour guide. He can secure them food if they would like it, but suggests lodging in Doma. (He doesn't much care for House Garlemald and his political views color his choices somewhat)

At the border between Garlemald and Doma another gate stands. Just as magnificent as the one leading into the city and flanked by several guards. As you pass through it, the decor changes. The stark white and rigid authority give way to a gentler, though no less regal archetecture. The doman guards are dressed in simple grey silk robes and carry long, slightly curved swords instead of the spears of Garlemald. The archecture has an exotic (japanese) asthetic and was clearly imported from elsewhere. The populace of doma is no less diverse, but the military officers of Garlemald are replaced by people of swarthy characters and bourterous temprement. Sailors clearly prefer Doma to Garlemald. Warder Nek is more at east in Doma (They're politics don't bother him and he finds the compassion with which they run the city inspiring) and is much more familiar with the sites. 
When the lightborn are ready he takes them to a small, unnamed library (he calls it the Gentle Rain) and leads them inside. The Gentle Rain, as its name implys is a peaceful place. As much room is speant for comfort and peace as is spent for the holding of books. There are a few individuals in the building, though none that seem to be in charge (they don't have a 'librarian' instead its more of a members run gentlemens club)(All of the patrons are Warders, watching the entrance to the circle and/or taking their leasure). Warder Nek grasps a candleabrah on the side of a bookcase and pulls. The shelf slides forward on silent rails and reveals a staircase leading down into a torch lit tunnel. The tunnel gently slopes down and continues for several hundred feet before ending at an elaborate spell steel door set into an equally elaborate spell steel wall.

"This is the entrance to the Cuff of the Father, or rather, the hand of Alexander. This is where we have our circle and where we conduct our business of maintainig the colossi. The speaker will meet us inside. There's no need to call for him, he has sureadly already forseen our arrival."

The door opens into a small steel tunnel that goes deeper into the colossus. The tunnel ends in a multiple level circular chamber with a spiral staircase at its center. The edges of the chamber are tiled with bookshelves crammed with books.

"This is the library and study, the meeting room is below us and the living quarters, laboratory and armory are above us."

The speaker sits queitly in a large plush chair at an ornate cherry wood table surrounded by a dozen other chairs. He is an elderly human with wispy white hair and liver spotted hands. His ears have a light point to them, hinting at some elven blood and that, perhaps, there is more to him than there seems. He introduces himself as the Speaker of Alexander and welcomes the Lightborn and warder nek to sit. He engages in pleasent conversation until it is clear the lightborn wish to speak of business. He answers their questions in a friendly and patient way.

The speaker has enough of a pull in the city to grant minor favors, and he will do so to help the Lightborn, however He won't burn any bridges for them(yet). He can get them an audience with Rabal, the former bull of ala mhigo, and can secure them lodging in the city (they could stay at the circle, but they may be more comfortable at an inn in Doma or Mhigo) He also grants them a stipend that will grant them a comfortable lifestyle plus 5 gp a month. He will arrange for traveling supplies and anything like that.
