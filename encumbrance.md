This is always a shit thing to think about. It rarely matters and almost always leads to more book keeping. However. Is there a way to make it matter? To make the book keeping important. That's really the crux. Any inventory system is going to have book keeping so making it matter is important.

what does it mean to matter? That's a good question. The effort needs to pay back in game play. It has to lead to interesting choices. 
    Do I carry x or y? Do I have the right tools for the job? Do we have enough supplies? Can we transport all that loot?

Weight based or volume based?

Middle ground? Weight based with max determined by bags/containers than str. Base on bag volume and holder weight? Size attribute? Maybe larger packs impose penalties on skills or vit drain?
