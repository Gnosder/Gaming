"""
Convert monsters from AtcotRG to 5e
Armor Class equals 19 minus the creature’s AC, up to AC 22.
Attack roll modifiers are HD/2 + 2, up to +12.
Saving throw DCs are 8 + HD/2, up to 20.
If a creature has to make a check or saving throw, and should be good at the roll, use the creature’s HD/2 + 2 as a bonus on the roll. Otherwise, use no modifier, or use a penalty to reflect something the creature should be bad at.
