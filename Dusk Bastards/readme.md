A role playing game by Gnosdy

Uses positve attrition. Heroic Roleplay. Build resources by playing. Victories make you stronger and turn into exp. 
When building characters: choose a powersource (Martial, Primal, Divine, Arcane, Occult) which determines how you generate resources. 
On long Rest: Regain all HP, loose all resources and victories, gain XP depending on victories.

Kill the null result?
    Null Result == You miss, next.
    Attacks auto hit, roll damage

Story telling system. 
Positive attrition
Victories
Degrading will
Powersource, role, camp role
Mana, stamina, Will
Will == HP. Temp and Max. As you take damage your temp decreases, when it hits zero you roll your current max, on pass it drops by one and refills your temp up to your new max.
    Massive damage == wounds which auto degrade will and impose a penalty
Stamina == WoD willpower. Expend for +3 to a roll, recover through victories
Mana == personal mana battery, small pool, refills every few minutes or on taking channel action.
Victories == can be cashed out for XP. Can regenerate Will and Stamina. Can power certain abilities.
XP == Victories + Current Will.
Full Rest == takes ~1 week, cash out victories, refill will to max.
Armor == extra will that is lost first
Aspirations grant extra victories when completed
saves: max will + current will

No attributes, only skills? WoD does att + Skill + misc. What about skill + will!

How does magic work? Aether is created by life and the WYLD, it is drawn from the world by users who shape it into effects and release it. Users can only hold so much at one time and have to channel more (draw it in) when their reserve runs dry. Shaping magic requires an imago (an image of what the spell will do, along with its effects; the better the imago the stronger the spell). Using a spell says something about the user. You can't use magic you don't belive in. If using a spell that goes against the casters nature, something happens.

    Spells have: A target, an effect, a radius, a range, tags
    When casting a spell choose a rote spell or free cast.
    When free casting: Choose a target, define an effect (one or more), determine power. Mana cost equals Effects + power and action roll equals power.
    Rote spells already define effects, determine target and power. Mana cost is power + rote discount. Action roll is power.


Spell Effects:
    Reflective:
        Knowing
    Tier 0:
        Damage (Fraying)
    Tier 1: 
        Shielding
        Debuffing (Unraveling)
        Veiling
        Control (Shape, aspected damage, duration)
        Healing
    Tier 2:
        Alter (Weaving)
        Summoning/ Conjuration
        Perfecting
    Tier 3:
        Making
        Unmaking

You can know and sense phenomenom reactivly or activly (reactive is limited). Damage is T0 becasue you're just blasting a target with Aether (you can shape it at T1 and deal aspected damage at T1). Duration is instant by default and can be made concentration for free. Increase duration steps by taking effect.

When taking an action, make an action roll. Combat: Pass x2 damage, fail x1 damage
