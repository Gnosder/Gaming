Side quest 2: A cut above

Heading into the desert to find Pippin, discover landark on desert edge, roll for second landmark, arrive at Windswept Holdfast. Pippin is not there, he was last seen heading towards the desert colossus.

Encounter the colossus, its been corrupted and a number of other corrupted are in the area. Pippin has been captured and is being corrupted.
>rescue Pippin, defeat the corrupted, cleanse the colossus.
Pippin and Lucylla are going to head back, they encourage the lightborn to take their time as they did a great thing. (Encourage side quests and exploration). The speaker can communicate through the colossus and says the same. He's still looking for the Spark Housing and waiting for more warder reports. Most colossi roam around and need to be located first. (tell the players that it's a good idea for them to strengthen themselves).
