AAR 2967/4/4 The Boaring Session

Written by Bruno Medal:

Adventurers: Four Fingers, Skip, Damon, Esir

Got bearings in Outlands. Went on simple excursion to surrounding area (0301). Discovered lair of four(4) Dire Boar of an unknown species. Notable features are extraordinarily large tusks and red-brown coat. The boars showed signs of having survived predation. Esir estimates a large, flying predator, supporting Teemo's report.

Explored the banks of the river (still unnamed) within that zone, saw clear signs of crocodilian creatures. There was nothing else of note in 0301.

Planned future expedition to 0302.

Duration: 1 day

Gain: None

Loss: None
