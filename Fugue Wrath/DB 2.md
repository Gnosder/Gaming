## Introduction
## Characters
Each character is made up of several parts. First is the descriptor, this is a word that roughly describes the character's greatest attribute. Each descriptor offers several bonuses. Second is the character's race or ancestry, this describes the character's physical or cultural form. While most races and ancestries do not convery any mechanical benefits they are an important asthetic that can impact the game's narrative. Third each character has a base class, these are drawn from a small pool and are immutable. Base classes grant important abilities and define a character's starting growth. Finally characters have a Focus or Advanced Class, these are specialized classes that are taken in addition to a base class. They further refine a character's powers and place in the world. Advanced classes can be changed while in a sanctuary.
Each character also has skills, equipment, and cyphers.

### Action Pools
There are 3 action pools that character has. These are called: Might, Speed, and Mind. Action pools represent your character's health and capacity for effort. Many actions, consequences, and effects drain points from your action pools.
### Actions
Every action has a difficulty -- this is set by the GM but follows a regular progression -- and any action with a chance for failure requires a die roll. Rolling dice is simple: You mearly roll a d20 and attempt to beat the difficulty of the action. There are a myriad of ways to add bonuses and negatives to your rolls but they fall into a few simple catagories.
    - Skills: If you are trained in a skill you gain +3 to your roll, if you are specilized your gain +6 instead. You can never gain more than +6 from skills to a single roll.
    - Assets: These are abilities and items that assist you with the action. These follow the same guidelines as skills with each asset granting +3 or +6 to the roll. Just like with skills, you can never gain more than +6 from assets to a single roll.
    - Effort: All characters can add effort to their actions by spending points from the related action pool. Each effort spent adds a +3 bonus to the roll. Each roll cannot gain more than +18 from effort.
        Note: The first level of effort spent costs 3 points from the pool and each subsequent level costs 2 points.
        Note: Each character has a maximum amount of effort they can spend based on their Effort stat.
        Note: When you spend points from a pool you may reduce the points you spend by that pool's edge value.
    - Hinderancs: When something gets in your way and makes your life harder you take a -3 to the roll. There is no limit to the amount of penalties you can take.
        Note: The GM will tell you any obvious hinderances before you attempt the action.

| Task Difficulty | Description  | Target No. | Guidance                                                             |
| :-------------: | :----------- | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        0        | Routine      |     0      | Any can do this basically every time                                 |
|        1        | Simple       |     3      | Most people can do this most of the time                             |
|        2        | Standard     |     6      | Typical task requiring focus, but most people can usually do this.   |
|        3        | Demanding    |     9      | Requires full attention: most people have a 50/50 chance to succeed. |
|        4        | Difficult    |     12     | Traid people have a 50/50 chance to succeed.                         |
|        5        | Challenging  |     15     | Even trained people fail often.                                      |
|        6        | Intimidation |     18     | Normal people almost never succeed.                                  |
|        7        | Formidable   |     21     | Impossible without skills or great effort.                           |
|        8        | Heroic       |     24     | A task worthy of tales told for years afterward.                     |
|        9        | Immortal     |     27     | A task worthy of legends that last lifetimes.                        |
|       10+       | Impossible   |     30     | A task that normal humans couldn't consider.                         |
### Skills
### Health
A character's health is shown by the size of their attribute pools. As those pools get smaller and smaller they get more and more tired and risk injury and even death.
#### Damage
When a character takes damage they remove that many points from the relevant pool. If the source of the damage does not specify which pool to remove the points from they are taken from Might.
##### Armor
Some characters have armor against certain types of damage. Whenever you take damage and your armor applies you subtract your armor from the damage taken and then take that much damage. Armor cannot reduce damage below 0. E.g. If you are struck by an arrow for 3 points of damage, but you have 2 points of armor you instead take 1 damage.
#### Wounds
Whenever an attribute pool reaches 0 points you take a wound. The type of wound received relates to the source of the damage that reduced your pool to 0. The first wound you receive is a minor wound. As long as you have a minor wound you are impaired. If your most severe wound is minor and would take another wound you roll 1d20 adding the number of wounds you have, on 11+ you gain a serious wound and become Debilitated. If your most severe wound is serious and you would take another, roll 1d20 adding twice the number of wounds you have, on 11+ you gain a critical wound and are dying.
    - Hale: The 'normal' state. No penalties.
    - Impared: Efforts costs 1 extra point per level. Ignore minor and major effects; and only gain +1 to damage on 17+.
    - Debilitated: As impared and must spend 1 level of effort to take any action other than moving half your speed.
    - Dying: Bleeding out. Cannot move or take actions, will be dead in d6 rounds (rolled in secret by the GM).
Minor wounds have a severity of 1 + 1d6.
Serious wounds have a severity of 8 + 2d6.
Critical wounds have a severity of 64 + 3d6.
#### Recovery
There are 2 types of rests, short and long.
Short rests restore points to your attribute pools. When you take a short rest you make a recovery roll and regain that many points divided as you choose between your pools. The first time you rest it takes 10 seconds (or 1 round in combat), the second time takes 10 minutes, the third takes an hour, and the fourth takes 10 hours (which is assumed to be a long rest).
Long rests restore all points to your attribute pools and allow you to recover from wounds. When you take a long rest you may make a recovery roll for each wound you have and reduce its severity by that much. Your status is determined by the most serious wound you have. If you have a serious or critical wound you are debilitated, if you have a minor wound you are impared, otherwise you are hale.
##### Stablizing the Dying
A dying character can be stabalized -- i.e. spared from dying -- through medical attention. The rules for doing so are listed under the Medicine Skill (Medicine vs 15 if effort is spent the dying character does not move closer to death even if the check fails). A stabalized character stops dying but is still debilitated and begins dying again if they would take any further wounds.
