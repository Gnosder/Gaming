# Magic
Each caster has a tradition, though some may have more than one, that defines how their magic operates. Most magic users follow the High Magic tradition, but others exist like Shamanism, Necromancy, Supplicant of the Light, and Scion of Power.
While a caster’s magic is primarily defined by their tradition there are some statistics that are universal. These are Spell attack, Drain resistance, and Power.

Spell attack: Magic + d20
Drain Resistance: Level + Magic
Drain roll: d20 + drain resistance
Power: Level + Magic + 10

There are 2 ways to cast spells: spontaneously and as a ritual.

### Spontaneous Casting
Spells cast this way are quick and dirty.They fatigue the caster, but allow for instantaneous, or near to it, effects.
It takes a full round to cast a spell this way, you may not move or take any other actions in the round in which you attempt to cast a spell.Once you have begun casting you follow these steps:
Choose a spell, adjust the DV, and select target(s).
The spell’s final DV may not be more than double your power.
You may spend 1 MP otherwise your spell resolves at initiative 0.
Resolve the spell making any rolls required.
Attack rolls, etc.
Make a Drain Roll against the spell’s drain value.
If you fail you lose stamina equal to the difference.
If the spell’s final DV is higher than your power you take double damage.
If you pass, you take no damage.
Note: Casting a spell while engaged in melee provokes an attack of opportunity.
Note: If you take damage between when you begin and finish casting a spell, the spell is lost and you check for drain adding half the damage taken to the spell’s DV.

### Ritual Casting
Rituals are slow but precise. They require focus, preparation, and time, but can achieve effects far beyond what can be accomplished through spontaneous casting. There are many rituals in the world. Each one requires you to lay your circle and amass a certain amount of Mana. 
The first step to casting a ritual is to “lay your circle”, a common way say “prepare the area for casting”. While each ritual can be improved with better circles, most can be drawn with a stick of chalk.
The second step is to actually perform the ritual. This means the high chanter (the one who is actually casting the ritual) begins to concentrate on the ritual and amass mana. Each chanter (an individual that is assisting in casting the ritual) can aid them.There are many ways to gain mana, a partial list is:
    Gain 1 Mana for each point of Magic of the High Chanter.
        Each chanter after the first grants mana equal to their magic minus 1.
    Gain 1 Mana for each time interval spent performing the Ritual. (Each ritual has different time intervals)
        All rituals require at least 1 time interval, even if their mana is met in immdediatly.
    Gain 1 Mana for each MP committed to the Ritual.
    Gain at least 1 Mana for every appropriate sacrifice.
        Note: Sacrifices required for the ritual do not give mana unless stated otherwise (it is consumed as part of the ritual).
Once the required amount of mana is acquired the ritual is complete and takes effect. If the High Chanter takes any damage or is prevented from concentrating on the ritual at any point the ritual fails. Any MP committed is not returned. Failed rituals may require the High Chanter to check for drain.

### Learning Spells

While each tradition has different ways of learning and researching magic there are some commoninalies to them. First: they all require a place of power appropriate to their tradition; commonly refered to as a Library and more fantastically as a Locus. Second: they all share (mostly) the same time and material costs.

## Magical Traditions

The most common type of magic is High Magic which interacts with Arcane energy, but others exist. The world of Algos also is infused with primal magic which gave way to Elementalism and Necromancy and vast amounts of Chaos and Eldritch energy have given rise to Malediction Magic and Warp Magic respectivly. 

Within each type there are innumerable schools and philosophies.

### High Magic


### Necromancy
Necromancy, like High Magic, draws on the arcane powers of the world. However, necromantic power comes from a different source, that being Thanergy (or death energy) which arises from Cell Death. While death releases Thanergy so too does the Wrath.

Necromantic Attributes
While Spell attack and drain resistance is calculated normally, power is not. A necromancer's power is directly related to the amount of Thanergy present. Thus their power attribute is: Level + Magic + Local Thanergy.

Within the safe zone there is not enough Thanergy to use necromancy without a “bloom” (initial instance of death), however in a wrath zone the Local Thanergy level is 10. Meaning it can be used at a “default” level. Many areas (tombs, ruins, etc) have a build up of Thanergy that places the local level at 12 or sometimes even higher. Blooms grant power 10 for one scene.

Necromancy and Wounds

The closer an individual is to death the greater their power. This is because as an individual nears death their body begins to release Thanergy that the necromancer can use.

Necromancers NEVER suffer wound penalties to their use of necromancy. Further they can draw on their wounds to give them bonuses to both attacks and drain resistance. Serious wounds grant +2 to both and Critical Wounds grant +6.

Necromantic Spells
The three Primary Schools of Necromancy are Bone, Flesh, and Spirit. A sampling of early spells and rituals are found below.

Servants of Bone — 12 — V,S,M — Conjure a skeletal minion for 3 rounds. These minions have 1 HD by default.
Reserve 1MP to conjure until destroyed
+2 DV for an additional minion
+1 DV for +1HD (up to half of your own, rounded up). 
If a bone is used as a material component to cast this spell, reduce the DV by 2.

Thanergic Lance — 12 — V,S — When this spell is learned choose one of the schools of necromancy (bone, flesh, or spirit). Expel a Bone lance, a Blood Bolt, or an Entropic Ray (depending on school chosen) to deal 1d10 damage to a target.
+3 DV for +1d10
+4 DV for a 10ft radius
+2 DV for secondary effect:
Bone: Causes a bleeding wound
Flesh: Causes lesions (diminished wound) and slowing (-4 Initiative)
Spirit: Causes weakness (-2 to all checks and damage)

Bone Sight — 10 — V,S — Detects the presence of Thanergy (undead, etc) and diagnoses wounds. Gain the ability to sense Thanergy within a 60ft range for 3 rounds. While this spell is active gain +2 bonus to Medicine Skill tests.
Reserve 1MP to maintain the spell.
+2 DV for +60ft range.
+1 DV for +3 Rounds
+4DV for +4 to medicine skill at cost of no longer being able to detect thanergy.


Speak with Spirits — Ritual — 10 —30 minutes — Summons a nearby spirit, allowing it to manifest for the duration of the ritual. If a creature’s remains are used in the ritual it targets that specific spirit. An unwilling spirit is given the ability to resist (High Chanter Will Save vs spirit’s DC), a spirit that has moved on is unable to be summoned.
NOTE: Using this ritual without a target can have devastating effects (some spirits are hateful of the living).

Bone Servant — Ritual — 20 — 1 hour — Creates a single skeletal servant. This servant lasts until destroyed and follows all commands given it by its creator and those it specifies. This servant is not “intelligent” and cannot communicate, it functions as a thrall or construct. It has 1 HD. Any number of bone servant’s can be created. If a mostly intact skeleton is used in the ritual the mana cost is reduced to 16.

Necromancers and Adventurers
Full Necromancers have the class ability Life Tap while half necromancers do not.

Life Tap: Consume half your maximum stamina to gain 1 MP for this round only (use it or lose it). Additionally, Wounds you receive heal twice as fast and you gain +1 grit from all sources.
