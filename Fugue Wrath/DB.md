Rules

Damage
Damage is removed from Stamina first.
When Stamina reaches 0 the character takes a WOUND and RALLIES.

Wounds
When a wound is taken roll 2d6 + half the damage that overflowed. I.e. if you had 5 stamina and took 7 damage, then 2 overflowed for a +1.
Each wound has a random value that is applied secretly to the character’s death threshold. When the Death threshold (which is 13) is met or exceeded the character dies.

The penalties imposed by wounds are mostly up to the narrative, however, these values are average:
Diminished wounds sometimes impose a -1
Serious wounds impose a -3 about half the time
Critical wounds impose a -5 all the time
Wounds can also grant other penalties as deemed appropriate by the GM.

Healing
Stamina is fully restored after a short rest.
1 MP is restored per short rest.

FP and MP  are fully restored after a long rest.
Wounds can attempt to be downgraded, one per long rest.

Wounds can be downgraded with healing. Diminished wounds can be removed while serious and Critical wounds can be diminished.

Medicine Skill
Possible Actions: 
Ease the dying
Treat Wounds
Treat Malady
Treat Wounds:
When attempting to treat a wound and/or diagnose its severity: Roll Medicine against the wound’s DC (Death Score + 10). For diagnosis it’s + on an even roll and - on an odd roll. Can be used once per wound per day.
Failure: Misdiagnose severity +-3 (minimum 1)
Pass: Diagnose severity at +-1 (minimum 1) and target gains gains 2 grit
Crit Pass: Diagnose severity exactly and target gains 3 grit
No grit granted for diminished wound.

Ease the Dying:
When an individual is critically wounded and dying you can attempt to stabalize them, or at least make them comfortable in the time they have left. Roll medicine against a target of {{high}}.
Crit Pass: They stabilize.
Pass: They stabilize for now, gain a cumulative +1 to future ease the dying rolls.
Fail: They are not stable, but do not progress closer to death, unless a previous roll has critically failed.
Crit Fail: They are unstable and move closer to death each round until an ease the dying roll is successful.

Treat Malady:
Make a medicine roll against the malady’s DC.
Crit Pass: Target gains +4 to next save against the malady.
Pass: Target gains +2 to next save against the malady.
Fail: Target gains +0 to next save against the malady.
Crit Fail: Target gains -2 to next save against the malady.

# Magic
Each caster has a tradition, though some may have more than one, that defines how their magic operates. Most magic users follow the High Magic tradition, but others exist like Shamanism, Necromancy, Supplicant of the Light, and Scion of Power.
While a caster’s magic is primarily defined by their tradition there are some statistics that are universal. These are Spell attack, Drain resistance, and Power.

Spell attack: Magic + d20
Drain Resistance: Level + Magic
Drain roll: d20 + drain resistance
Power: Level + Magic + 10

There are 2 ways to cast spells: spontaneously and as a ritual.
Spontaneous Casting
Spells cast this way are quick and dirty.They fatigue the caster, but allow for instantaneous, or near to it, effects.
It takes a full round to cast a spell this way, you may not move or take any other actions in the round in which you attempt to cast a spell.Once you have begun casting you follow these steps:
Choose a spell, adjust the DV, and select target(s).
The spell’s final DV may not be more than double your power.
You may spend 1 MP otherwise your spell resolves at initiative 0.
Resolve the spell making any rolls required.
Attack rolls, etc.
Make a Drain Roll against the spell’s drain value.
If you fail you lose stamina equal to the difference.
If the spell’s final DV is higher than your power you take double damage.
If you pass, you take no damage.
Note: Casting a spell while engaged in melee provokes an attack of opportunity.
Note: If you take damage between when you begin and finish casting a spell, the spell is lost and you check for drain adding half the damage taken to the spell’s DV.

Ritual Casting
	Rituals are slow but precise. They require focus, preparation, and time, but can achieve effects far beyond what can be accomplished through spontaneous casting. There are many rituals in the world. Each one requires you to lay your circle and amass a certain amount of Mana. 
The first step to casting a ritual is to “lay your circle”, a common way say “prepare the area for casting”. Each ritual has different requirements for a circle and, while most can be met with a stick of chalk, more well made circles can make the casting easier.
The second step is to amass mana while performing the ritual. The primary individual involved in a ritual is referred to as the High Chanter and each other individual that assists is a Chanter. There are many ways to gain mana, a partial list is:
Gain 1 Mana for each point of Magic of the High Chanter.
Each chanter after the first grants mana equal to their magic minus 1.
Gain 1 Mana for each hour spent performing the Ritual.
Gain 1 Mana for each MP committed to the Ritual.
Gain at least 1 Mana for every appropriate sacrifice.
Once the required amount of mana is acquired the ritual is complete and takes effect. If the High Chanter takes any damage or is prevented from concentrating on the ritual at any point the ritual fails. Any MP committed is not returned. Failed rituals may require the High Chanter to check for drain.

Magical Traditions
The most common magical tradition is High Magic

High Magic


Necromancy
Necromancy, like High Magic, draws on the arcane powers of the world. However, necromantic power comes from a different source, that being Thanergy (or death energy) which arises from Cell Death. While death releases Thanergy so too does the Wrath.

Necromantic Attributes
While Spell attack and drain resistance is calculated normally, power is not. A necromancer's power is directly related to the amount of Thanergy present. Thus their power attribute is: Level + Magic + Local Thanergy.

Within the safe zone there is not enough Thanergy to use necromancy without a “bloom” (initial instance of death), however in a wrath zone the Local Thanergy level is 10. Meaning it can be used at a “default” level. Many areas (tombs, ruins, etc) have a build up of Thanergy that places the local level at 12 or sometimes even higher.

Necromancy and Wounds

The closer an individual is to death the greater their power. This is because as an individual nears death their body begins to create and release Thanergy that the necromancer can use.

Necromancers NEVER suffer wound penalties to their use of necromancy. Further they can draw on their wounds to give them bonuses to both attacks and drain resistance. Serious wounds grant +2 to both and Critical Wounds grant +6.

Necromantic Spells
The three Primary Schools of Necromancy are Bone, Flesh, and Spirit. A sampling of early spells and rituals are found below.

Servants of Bone — 12 — V,S,M — Conjure a skeletal minion for 3 rounds. These minions have 1 HD by default.
Reserve 1MP to conjure until destroyed
+2 DV for an additional minion
+1 DV for +1HD (up to half of your own, rounded up). 
If a bone is used as a material component to cast this spell, reduce the DV by 2.

Thanergic Lance — 12 — V,S — When this spell is learned choose one of the schools of necromancy (bone, flesh, or spirit). Expel a Bone lance, a Blood Bolt, or an Entropic Ray (depending on school chosen) to deal 1d10 damage to a target.
+3 DV for +1d10
+4 DV for a 10ft radius
+2 DV for secondary effect:
Bone: Causes a bleeding wound
Flesh: Causes lesions (diminished wound) and slowing (-4 Initiative)
Spirit: Causes weakness (-2 to all checks and damage)

Bone Sight — 10 — V,S — Detects the presence of Thanergy (undead, etc) and diagnoses wounds. Gain the ability to sense Thanergy within a 60ft range for 3 rounds. While this spell is active gain +2 bonus to Medicine Skill tests.
Reserve 1MP to maintain the spell.
+2 DV for +60ft range.
+1 DV for +3 Rounds
+4DV for +4 to medicine skill at cost of no longer being able to detect thanergy.


Speak with Spirits — Ritual — 10 —30 minutes — Summons a nearby spirit, allowing it to manifest for the duration of the ritual. If a creature’s remains are used in the ritual it targets that specific spirit. An unwilling spirit is given the ability to resist (High Chanter Will Save vs spirit’s DC), a spirit that has moved on is unable to be summoned.
NOTE: Using this ritual without a target can have devastating effects (some spirits are hateful of the living).

Bone Servant — Ritual — 20 — 1 hour — Creates a single skeletal servant. This servant lasts until destroyed and follows all commands given it by its creator and those it specifies. This servant is not “intelligent” and cannot communicate, it functions as a thrall or construct. It has 1 HD. Any number of bone servant’s can be created. If a mostly intact skeleton is used in the ritual the mana cost is reduced to 16.

Necromancers and Adventurers
Full Necromancers have the class ability Life Tap while half necromancers do not.

Life Tap: Consume half your maximum stamina to gain 1 MP for this round only (use it or lose it). Additionally, Wounds you receive heal twice as fast and you gain +1 grit from all sources.

FFoD: Procedure
Determine Trove Dice
Divide Trove dice between coins and items (white, yellow) and roll
Record total value of each color. White is # of items, yellow is multiplied by coin multiplier for total value of coins.
Roll for quality. Roll a dice for each item. On a 1, an item has a quality.
Roll a die for each item that has a quality. 3 or less is inferior, greater than 3 is superior.
Roll which item has a quality. Roll a die for each inferior (red) and superior (green) item and each other item (white) to determine its type.
Record item types as per F2.
Determine and record rarity of each item.
For each item roll and record value.
For each item determine and record type and characteristics (using Trease pg. 5+ makes this easier)
NOTE: For Dusk Bastards multiply all gp values by 35 for their silver value

Example of record at step 8:
7 items, 500gp
T T- G G+ A A A+
2 trade goods, one inferior
2 gemstones, one superior
Three art, one superior


Magic Items and Wrath
Wrath is usually found separate from treasure and comes in 3 types: crystal, bloom, and Heart. Crystals tend to be 50sp each, blooms are 1s500sp, and Hearts are 35,000sp
Magic items can be found in some hordes and are rolled separately.

The Book of Kahi (Book of the Dead)
A leather bound volume of about 300 pages, it is written in a lost language in a small, cramped handwriting. A few dozen loose pages are kept in the back of the tome written in Eyan Common that contain a translation of the first few chapters of the book as well as translation notes. These notes were written, presumably, by Heilda.

The translated first chapter of the book details the basic theory of Necromancy as well as its most basic spells and rituals. The notes contain a name, Kahi Akarana, after the Speak with Spirits ritual.

Necromantic Basics:

Necromancy uses the power of Thanergy or Death Energy that is generated by the deaths of living creatures, specifically the cell death of living creatures. When a creature dies it generates a “bloom” of thanergy that feeds necromantic abilities. Most areas do not have enough ambient Thanergy to power even the most basic spell, making necromancers all but powerless until a bloom is created.
Some diseases, particularly ‘wasting’ diseases like cancer and leprosy, can provide a necromancer with a small but endless reserve of thanergy (essentially powering their magic off their own body’s degradation).
The three schools of Necromancy are Bone, Blood, and Spirit — though lesser sub-schools exist as well. Bone is primarily, as the name implies, concerned with bone crafting, that is, the creation of skeletal constructs. Most of these constructs are humanoid in appearance as it’s easiest to replicate one’s own anatomy rather than to create a new one. However skeletal remains can also be used and reanimated. It’s important to note that while having physical remains can make the spell casting easier it is not needed; skeletal constructs can be manifested purely out of thanergy.
Blood, as a school, deals with meat. Specifically the blood, flesh, and viscera of living creatures. Blood magic can bolster or diminish creatures in addition to a myriad of other effects. While it is seen as less “pure” than bone it is also more wide ranging.
Spirit magic is the most difficult and least understood of the schools. It deals with the manipulation of the soul and the River. Though its meaning is muddied it is often understood to be the afterlife or the route to it.

Notes written by Heilda indicate that the Wrath zone has a base level of Thanergy despite what the book says about most areas having none. Thus a bloom is not needed while one is in the wrath zone.
