# Gridania
Ruins as found in the 4th age.

Ancient trees infested with wrath. Feels like a war between wrath and nature. Nature has lost.
The buildings are ruined and almost unnoticeable save for a few.

Haunted by Voidsent and wrath zombies. Seedseer Kan-e-sena still lives in the conjurer's guild, but will not leave (the elements need him to fight back the wrath).
