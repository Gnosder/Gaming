# Characters

Characters are important. Without them you cannot interact with the world of the game. Your character is your avatar and proxy in the game. While you can do anything you can think of in a role playing game, for the sake of fairness and playability some of your character's traits are distilled into numbers. While the statistics listed on your character sheet do not represent everything your character can do they should serve as a starting point.

## What Makes a Character

Characters are made up of many parts. However the 3 most important pieces are: Attributes, Stamina, and Skills.

Attributes come in 6 types: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma, Magic, and Faith.
    Strength: Impacts melee attacks, melee damage, and carry capacity
    Dexterity: Impacts defense, ranged attacks, and reflex saves
    Constitution: Impacts maximum stamina, constitution saves
    Charisma: Impacts will saves, and leadership
    Magic: Impacts mana and maximum force of spells
    Faith: Impacts luck saves and faith refresh

Stamina, Wounds, and Mana are the primary resources of the game.
    Stamina: Your maximum health before you become wounded.
    Wounds: Physical injuries and debeletations, too many and you die.
    Mana: Magical power that infuses the world and grants abilities.

Skills: there are 10 primary skills
    Alertness: Sometimes called perception, spot, or listen. Alertness is often used to notice things or determine initiative.
    Athletics: A measure of your physical abilities and coordination. Climb, Swim, Jump, Run.
    Medicine: Your knowledge and ability to perform first aid and other medical tasks. Used to diagnose and treat wounds.
    Performance: Your performative abilities.
    Persuasion: Your ability to convince others
    Search: The other part of perception. Whereas alertness is instant and reactive, search is deliberate and takes time.
    Stealth: Your ability to hide both yourself and your actions from notice.
    Survival: Your abiilty to navigate and survive in the wilderness
    Tinkering: Your crafting abiilty and knowledge
    Know: This skill covers multiple academic skills and is usually qualified with a discipline (Arcana, Religon, Local, etc).

## Creating Characters

In order to create a character you:
    - Determine your base attributes.
        Roll 2d6 for each attribute and consult the following chart. You may switch any 2 attributes of your choice.
            | Roll | Score |
            | :--: | :---: |
            |  2   |  -1   |
            | 3-5  |   0   |
            | 6-8  |  +1   |
            | 9-11 |  +2   |
            |  12  |  +3   |
        Or you may the following: 2,1,0,0,0,-1 and assign them as you wish.
    - Choose your race.
        Human
        Halfling
        Dwarf
        Elf
        If you wish to determine your race randomly roll 2d6 and consult the table:
            | Roll  |   Race   |

            |  2-3  |  Dwarf   |
            |  4-7  |  Human   |
            | 8-10  | Halfling |
            | 11-12 |   Elf    |
    - Choose a class (Fighter, Expert, Magic User, Adventurer)
        Note: Adventurer is a mix of 2 classes and allows healer and monk to be chosen.
    - Choose your skills.
        You have 12 points to allocate among your skills, unless you're an expert in which case you have 16.
        No skill can be higher than +4 at the start.
    - Buy your starting gear.
