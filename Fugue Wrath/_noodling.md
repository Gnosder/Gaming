# Magic

Each caster has a tradition, though some may have more than one, that defines how their magic operates and where its power comes from. Most magic users follow the High Magic tradition, but others exist like Shamanism, Necromancy, Supplicant of the Light, and Scion of Power.
While a caster’s magic is primarily defined by their tradition there are some statistics that are universal. These are Spell attack, and drain save.

Spell attack: Magic + d20
Drain save: Magic + Base save

All spells cost mana to cast. Further there are 3 ways to cast spells: spontaneously, as a ritual, and enchanting.

## Mana

Each character has mana. Even if they don't have access to spells or magical training, though magic users have more. Mana is a natural phenominon.
A character's maximum mana is equal to their magic stat and does not increase, except in the case of magic users.
Spent mana recovers at a rate of 1d4 an hour, but never more than the environment's mana saturation.

Mana Saturation: Magic is everywhere and in all things. In high concentrations it bleeds into the environment and is available for easy use by magic users. Mana Saturation refers to how much loose mana is available in the area, most cities on Algos have a Mana Saturation rating of 2, and the more natural areas can have a higher rating.

If a caster uses more mana than they have they take resistant stamina damage equal to double the mana they need o spend. This damage lowers the character's maximum stamina until they are able to benefit from bed rest.

A magic user may channel mana while casting a spell. They gain mana equal to the area's saturation rating each round they channel. This mana can only be spent on the spell being cast and is lost when the spell is cast or the caster's channeling is disrupted. While channeling a caster may not roll defense or reflex, failling all such saves automatically, further they must make a Will save (DC 11 + Mana Held) whenever they lose stamina. Failure means the channeling ends and the mana gained is lost.

## Spontaneous Casting

Spells cast this way are quick and dirty.They fatigue the caster, but allow for instantaneous, or near to it, effects.
It takes a full round to cast a spell this way, you may not move or take any other actions in the round in which you attempt to cast a spell. Once you have begun casting you follow these steps:
    - Choose the spell you wish to cast
    - Set the force for the spell, up to twice your magic.
        All spells have a base force required and most have additional effects with more.
    - Choose targets for the spell
    - Cast Spell
        Determine Effect; rolling to hit as needed
        Spend 1d4 mana per force, save vs. Drain for half
        Roll for Paradox if Force > your Magic
    - Determine Ongoing (penalty to further spell casting)
        Each spell sustained incures a -2 penalty to all further actions.

## Ritual Casting

Some spells don't lend themselves to the quick and dirty casting most magic users employ. These spells require a ritual. All rituals have a leader and require a circle, but other requirements can vary. The process for performing a ritual is as follows:
    - Choose a Ritual Leader
    - Choose the Ritual (the leader must know it)
    - Choose Force (Max twice the leader's magic)
        All rituals have a base force required and most have additional effects with more.
    - Create Circle
        Unless otherwise specified a simple circle of chalk or dirt is sufficient.
    - Perform Sacrifice (If the ritual requires one)
    - Perform the Ritual (Determine the effect of the ritual)
    - Save vs. Drain (each participant does so seperately, though they may use the leader's save instead of their own)

## Enchanting

Enchaning is the process of embuing magic into items allowing the enchanter to create wands, staves, potions, and other magic items. The process is as follows:
    - Choose Formula of the item to be created
    - Choose Item to be enchanted
    - Expend Resources
    - Test Skill (vs. creation DC): Tinker + Magic vs DC
    - Save vs. Fatigue

There are additional costs and risks to enchanting that casting and rituals don't have. The first is that enchanting requires material resources, these take many forms and are laid out by the formula. Enchanting also takes time, which is also laid out by the formula though general times can be found below. Secondly, enchanting is equal parts magic use and crafting, as such it requires a Tinker check. Finally, enchanting imposes a special type of drain called Fatigue. Fatigue works like drain but recovers each week rather than each day.

## Paradox:

Shaping magic is difficult and can interact with the world in unexpected ways. Whenever you cast a spell with a force greater than your magic the world pushes back, this is paradox.

When paradox is incurred roll 1d6 and consult the following table. On a 5 or 6 roll 1d100 and consult either the mutation or wild paradox table.

| Roll | Effect    | Description                                                        |
| :--: | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-2  | Mana Burn | Suffer physical damage equal to mana cost                          |
|  3   | Wildfire  | The spell goes out of control and gains new targets                |
|  4   | Summoning | A creature attuned to the spell appears with HD equal to the force |
|  5   | Degen     | Suffer a mutation or deformity (as a wound)                        |
|  6   | Random    | Roll on wild surge table                                           |
|      |           |                                                                    |

|      | Withered            | Suffer resistant wound or deformity          |
|      | Cast on Self        | One spell cast at random centered on you     |
|      | Blink               | Gain Blink                                   |
|      | Spectacular Failure | The spell fails and has an unintended effect |

### Learning Spells

While each tradition has different ways of learning and researching magic there are some commoninalies to them. First: they all require a place of power appropriate to their tradition; commonly refered to as a Library and more fantastically as a Locus. Second: they all share (mostly) the same time and material costs.

MAGIC
| Activity                                             | Time Required    | Cost     |

| Writing a Scroll                                     | Force x 2d6 days | 50sp/day |
| Transcribing a Spell from a Spellbook to a Spellbook | Force x 1d3 days | 20sp/day |
| Transcribing a Spell from a Scroll to a Spellbook    | Force x 1d6 days | 10sp/day |
| Researching a Spell on the Spell List                | Force x 3d6 days | 25sp/day |
| Researching a New Spell                              | Force x 4d6 days | 30sp/day |

## Magical Traditions

The most common type of magic is High Magic which interacts with Arcane energy, but others exist. The world of Algos also is infused with primal magic which gave way to Elementalism and Necromancy and vast amounts of Chaos and Eldritch energy have given rise to Malediction Magic and Warp Magic respectivly.

        Components: V,S
        Duration: 1 hour

        This spell is always cast as force 0 and as such never requires a roll.
        This spell is a m inor m agical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the
        following magical effects within range:
            • You create an instantaneous, harm less sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
            • You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
            • You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.

    Unerring Action
        Range: Touch
        Components: V,S
        Duration: 1 Minute

        You grant a target a brief view into a possible future. For as long as this spell lasts the target may reroll any action they take, doing so ends the spell. A target effected by this spell more than once in a 24 hour period sees too much and must make a Will save (DC set by GM) or be confused/frightened/sickend (chosen by the GM) by what they see in the future. Once a creature fails this Will save they will also fail any additional saves required by this spell for 1 week.
        Higher Forces: At force 6, the target no longer has to make a save for additional uses. At force 9, the spell can be used any number of times within its duration.

    Alarm
        Ritual
        Range: Touch
        Components: V,S
        Duration: Sustained (24 hours)

        You ward an area with an alarm. Any creauture or object that enters the area of the ward causes either an auditory or telepathic alert. You may instead set the alarm to a certain time or event that it will respond to instead of creatures.
        The size of the area scales with force of the spell.

    Charm
        Range: 30ft
        Components: V
        Duration: Sustained (1 minute)

        A thinking target you can see within range of the spell must make a will save or fall under your control for the duration of the spell. During this time the target treats you as a trusted friend and obeys you without question. If you make the target take any actions that are directly opposed to their values or the places them in danger they may make another will save against this effect.
        When the spell ends (either by duration or when a will save is made) the target suffers a brief period of disorentation (compounded by anything they had to do while charmed). The target will remember everything they did while charmed and know that they were not in control of themselves. I.e. this spell IS NOT subtle.

    Spray
        Range: 15ft
        Components: V,S
        Duration: Instant

        When learned choose one elemental damage type (Force, Fire, Cold, Lightning, Acid, Necrotic, Radiant), this choice may not be changed, but the spell may be learned multiple times and different elements can be chosen each time.
        You create a 15ft cone shaped wave of the chosen element dealing 1d6 damage on a hit to all targets caught in it. Creatures targeted by this spell may make a reflex saving throw for half damage.
        Higher Forces: At force 2 the damage of this spell increases to 1d10, at force 3 the spell gains elemental effects and gains 1d10 damage per force after the second.

    Detect Magic
        Range: 30ft
