- Rewrote the class section
    - Sweeping changes to all classes
    - Stamina decreased across the board.
- Fighter's Killing Blow ability now reads "When a Fighter inflicts damage with any attack they may add their character level rounded up to the damage done."
    The extra damage makes up for losing STR on damage rolls.
