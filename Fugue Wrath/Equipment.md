# Equipment

## Currency

The base currency is the Silver Piece (SP) these typically weigh around 9 grams and are standardized throughout a realm or city. While the styling of the coin can change the metal itself tends to have a set value, thus sp from different areas are typically interchangable. 

Some other common coinage is the Copper Peice (CP), which is generally 1/10 the value of the SP, and the Gold Peice (GP), which is generally 10 times the value of the SP. However, local forces can impact these values. For example, in the kingdom of Gaxton 1gp is worth 50sp (due to the rarity of gold in the area).

Other metal and alloys are sometimes used, such as platnium, electrum, rose gold, etc. The value of these coins usually relates to the rarity of the materials used. Platnium is typically worth 100sp, electrum is worth 3sp, and rose gold is worth 8sp.

While some areas use bank notes they are not common and are typically not accepted outside the area in which they are issued.

50 coins weigh about a pound and 500 coins is 1 bulk. It's not important to keep exact track of the weight of coins, simple round down to the nearest bulk. E.g. 999 coins is 1  bulk, not 2.

## Encumbrance 

Creatures can only carry so much. The amount a being can carry is a function of the weight of the item, the size of the item, and the item's general akwardness to carry. This can add up quickly and become cumbersome and so the method of carrying items is simplified as Bulk. 1 Bulk is generally 2-5 kilograms (~5-10 pounds) while an item of a few grams is negligable, everything between the 2 is considered light (L). 10 L items are 1 bulk, rounding down any fractions. E.g. 9 L items is negligable.

While bulk is generally thought of in terms of weight it is important to remember that weight is only one factor. Light, but cumbersome objects can have bulks far larger than their weight. E.g. a 10 ft pole, even though it weighs less than a kg is considered bulk 2 because it is so akward to carry.

### Encumbrance Limits

Each small or medium sized creature can carry a number of bulk equal to 5 + their strength before becoming encumbered and a maximum of 10 + their strength before being unable to move.

For each size category larger than medium the creature's bulk is multiplied by 10.

### Item Quality

The prices listed here are for items of average quality and with little to no adornment. The chart below shows the average cost of items of varying qualities and adornments. As quality increases it becomes harder and harder to list a set price, the chart below is mearly a starting point. Poor items typically wear out twice as fast on average and have double the chance to break. High quality items can infer a +1 bonus on their actions. Higher quality items do not.

| Quality     | Price Modifier |
| :---------- | :------------: |
| Poor        |      x.75      |
| Average     |       x1       |
| High        |       x2       |
| Lavish      |       x5       |
| Engraved    |       x2       |
| Bejewled    |       x4       |
| Custom Work |       x2       |

### Item Breakage

Every item has a chance to break or become worn through use. For most items this will not be an issue as simple items can last a long time even without maintenance. However there comes a time when even the most robust tool can break.

When a tool is used improperly, poorly over a short time (days), used without maintenance (months), used with maintenance (years) it has a chance to break. Each time an item has a chance to break roll 1d6, on a 1 the item breaks and must be replaced or repaired before it can be used again.

Block and Tackle: Useful for lifting heavy items. A properly anchored block and tackle doubles the amount of bulk a character can lift.
Compass: Grants +2 bonus to navigation checks and automatically determine direction of travel. Note non-magical compasses rely on there being a magnetic pole. If there is not or if something interfers with it, the compass is useless.
Lantern: A pint of oil in a lantern burns for 1 turn. Lanterns come in two main types, bullseye and hooded. Bullseye lanterns cast light in a 60ft cone infront of them and can be covered without disrupting the flame. Hooded lanterns cast light 30ft around themselves and can be covered witout disterbing the flame.
Musical Instrument: This is a broad class of items within which the price and bulk can vary greatly. However, for simple hand instruments (flute, harp, drum, lute) the price ranges from a few copper to a few silver and the bulk is usually L with larger instruments (lute, guitar) being 1 bulk.
Ration: An abstracted item reprsenting appropriate food and water for a creature. Creatures consume a number of rations per day based on their size with medium creatures consuming 10. Creatures who consume fewer rations than required recieve a -2 penalty to actions until they get 3 days of normal rations.
Supply: An abstracted item representing all the varius adventuring items that competent adventuers pack. Generally at any point a character can spend a number of supply on any of the items listed on the supply chart. If there is ever any doubt as to whether a character remembered to pack an item they can make a luck save against the supply cost of the item + 10.
Tent: Pup tents are large enough to hold only a single small or medium creature and keep them reasonably protected from the elements. Sleeping in a tent allows a creature to refresh 1 FP per night.

## Retainers

Retainers are NPCs hired to aid characters in their journies, no matter what those might be. From brave porters to swarthy workmen to skilled professionals retainers cover a large base. In game terms retainers have a price, a loyalty, and a benefit. As the game goes on and retainers are interacted with they can become more important and/or connected to the characters, this can come with benefits.

* Modifiers are to the BASE value of the area. Multiple instances of the same role do not stack.
Non-adventuring retainers are typically attached to a specific area or role and grant a bonus to the value of that area or role. In the case of servants and assistants, if the number needed is not met than the area or role losses its bonus. For laborers and Artisans the work cannot begin or progress without the required number.
** Professional Assistant is a catch all title for any assisstants that may be needed. I.e. an assistant Alchemist, assistant physician, etc. They typically expect to be paid 75% of what their supervisor is paid.

#### Sidebar: Shares

A share is a portion of the wealth recovered from an expedition. Each person has a share value. At the end of an expidention divide the total loot by the sum of everyone's shares to determine how much of the loot each share is worth. Player characters can generally set their own shares but values of 5 or 6 are common among more community minded individuals (pirates and the like) while other some particularly greedy individuals can have as much as 100 shares. 
Pay is generally considered important for adventurers and large disparities in pay between the lowest and highest paid members can breed resentment and lower retainer loyalty.

#### Retainer Loyalty

All retainers have a loyalty to their employers that will change over time. Well treated and/or paid retainers' loyalty will increase while mistreated or poorly paid retainers' loyalty will decrease. Loyalty is set when a retainer is hired and changes when they get paid or something happens to effect their loyalty. Note: Its easier to lose loyalty than it is to gain it.
Events that can effect loyalty are changes in pay or living situation, deaths of other retainers (especially if the employer is complicit), poor treatment, scndalous or illegal events, changes in employer.

#### Retainer Death Benefits

Death is always a risk for any expedition. Its common for retainers to request benefits be paid to family or next of kin in the event of their death. These death benefits are generally expected to be 300% ( or 3 times) their expected pay. The benefits are usually taken out of the leader's pay.

#### Hiring Retainers

When hiring retainers roll 3d6 and add the hiring character's Charisma and any other bonuses or penalties listed below (hiring event 4.2.1) and then consult the hiring chart 4.2.2.

Chart 4.2.1
| Hiring Event                                             | Modifier |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :------: |
| Pay is 50% more than expected                            |    +1    |
| Pay is 10% less than expected                            |    -1    |
| Employer has a positive reputation                       |    +1    |
| Employer has a negative reputation                       |    -2    |
| The position is going to last more than a month          |    +1    |
| The position comes with room and board                   |    +1    |
| If living quarters are expected and they are 50% larger  |    +1    |
| If living quarters are expected and they are 10% smaller |    -1    |
| The position is going to last more than a year           |    +2    |

A modifier can effect a roll more than once. For example if the pay is 50% less than normal then a -5 applies.
To get the bonus for positions lasting more than a month or year a contract is typically created specifying that, in the event the employment ends, the employee is entitled to up to half the remaining pay.
