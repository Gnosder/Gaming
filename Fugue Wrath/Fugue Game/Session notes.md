        Grinhilda: Profane Ossuary -- (Eris Morne) A relic from a Zratchan Necromancer, a calcified dragon bone in a glowing green orb of energy. Said to contain the knowledge of Al'kazir who sailed the river. The relic grants increased potency to necromantic rituals, granting a free +1 effort.
        Mot: Shocking Resistance -- When you take damage you may take damage to your mana instead. Each point of mana lost this way deals 1 damage to the attacker.

    Hive Parlay: Hashladûn wants access to the coils, she wants the key. She is willing to trade powerful Alagan and Hive artefacts for it. She also promises peace to the people of Gaxton. (She is tempered though she does not make it obvious).

# Session 19

Pre-session: Loose map of Azis Lla, Hive parlay plan, reward for freeing Tiamat
    Reward: Materia to each
        Lola: Second Breakfast -- all party members receive a second 10 minute rest each day.
        Gene: Dancing Waves -- Freedom of Movement in water, reserve 2 mana to grant to another person (no max)
        Grinhilda: Profane Ossuary -- (Eris Morne) A relic from a Zratchan Necromancer, a calcified dragon bone in a glowing green orb of energy. Said to contain the knowledge of Al'kazir who sailed the river. The relic grants increased potency to necromantic rituals, granting a free +1 effort.
        Mot: Shocking Resistance -- When you take damage you may take damage to your mana instead. Each point of mana lost this way deals 1 damage to the attacker.
        Bo: Smoke Bomb -- If you would get hit by a melee attack you may spend 3 mana to switch places with an ally within 30ft. They are hit by the attack instead.
        Bob: Holmgang -- Expend all of your mana and suffer a wound. For the next minute you cannot be reduced below 1 HP save for massive damage. Further, a target you choose is magically taunted for the duration (Will save to negate for a round).
    Hive Parlay: Hashladûn wants access to the coils, she wants the key. She is willing to trade powerful Alagan and Hive artefacts for it. She also promises peace to the people of Gaxton. (She is tempered though she does not make it obvious).
    Map of Azis Lla: See map.

9/24/1190
    Hive leader Hashladûn arrived at the frayed mountain to parlay. It started good, but when she realized the party knew more than she thought they did she shifted tactics. She has threatened to march the Hive against Gaxton unless they give her the key to the coils. (She will also spy on them with scrying magic to see if they go to the coils; she can get in, but she does not know where they are.)

Pre-Session:
    King Gundolf Hightower has learned of the agency and is willing to help, though he is not pleased, he knows of Sephirot and that he is the cause of the wrath. He also knows that some legendary knights from the 3rd age assulted the coils, but never returned.

    The entry way into the coils is through the sepalcure, the bottom room where they fought the banshee (Bruccia Nerva). Wall melts away.

The Coils: Allagan, damaged, limited self repair, steril
    Entry way, signs of battle, bodies of knights (all by 3 accounted for). Leads to the battle of the Holy Trinity (3 knights, tempered, immortal, must all be killed at the same time or they come back to life)

    Holy Trinity
        25 hp, att 18, AC 18, damage 6
            Tibebu, the Axe
                When he strikes a taunted target he deals double damage.
            Yideg, the Keeper
                Deals 4 damage and taunts hit target. Deals 2 damage every time he is struck in melee.
                2 AC
            Mikias, the Blade
                When an attack misses him, he teleports to the attacker and makes an attack of his own.
            Whenever one of them is brought to zero HP one of the others begins to channel resurrection. Takes 2 rounds. If successful the dead knight returns with full HP.

    Loot:
        Boots of Vengence - When an attack misses the wearer, teleport 30ft and gain an action (once per encounter)
        Coif of Insight - Wearer gains the effect of Detect Lies and see invisibility
        Spike of Restoration - (spring loaded syringe) Can be used to restore 3d6 HP, but costs the user 1d6 HP. HP lost this way cannot be restored save by resting.

    Dream of the Dead
        You find yourself on the deck of a wide river boat. It is richly decorated with gold embossed bones. A hawkish man with a pale complextion stands at the bow, a scythe made of bone at his side, his eyes scan the horizon. You know him insticivly, Thanatos God of death and son of Nyx. Standing at the helm of the boat is a cloaked figure, stoic and inevitable, Charon, the ferryman of the dead. You look around you, and realize you are not sailing on a rive so much as your sailing in it. Souls flow around the boat twisting in the churning eddy of the river around you. With a start you awaken.
