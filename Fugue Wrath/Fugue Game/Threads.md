A list and summary of the various floating plot threads.

The Origin of the Wrath
    Breadcrumbs/Signposts: Mt. Hightower
    Mt. Hightower is a protective shell created by the *Coils of Dalamur* which were an Allagan containment device used to hold Sephirot in statis and prevent his corruption from spreading.
Ghosts of the Hive
    Breadcrumbs/Signposts: Escalating Hive activity, Mutants of the Hollowed Bastion
    The Tusked Hive brood mother, Hashlad√ªn, has stirred from her dormancy. She wants to free Sephirot who speaks to her in her dreams and has *taken* her.
Shadows over Mach
    Breadcrumbs/signposts: Vauge mentions of Mach
    The Void ark raid series from ff14. Ozma has the ability to penetrate the barrier around Izis Lla.
    Discover the Void Ark, Diablos has an Allagan Key Stone he is using to break the wards on the imprissoned voidsent. He will escape with the coffin of Scathach and flee to Dun Scaith. Signs will point there but also mention the need for the Nullstone (which is in Mach) to kill him for good (the compass will also point there and it will unlock the reaper class). Ozma is in Mach and its remains can take the shield off Izis Lla. 
Dreams of Amdapor
