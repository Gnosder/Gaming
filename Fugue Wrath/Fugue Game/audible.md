 All the work I did... I don't like it. Don't switch to a new system. Just improve the one you have.

 Stamina can be spent for effort.
    1 for 1; buff to damage or action. Max is level.
 Mana can be spent for spell casting
 Fate can be spent to reroll

 Def != Armor

 Armor subtract damage
    Light: 1, medium: 2, Heavy: 3
Defense
    Skill

Wounds go away
Damage Track: 
    HP = 0: Wounded (-2) > Critical (-6) > Dead
        No yoyo!
        When at 0 can spend 1 fate to not take damage from a source.
    Mana = 0: Winded
    Fate = 0

Rest ala Cypher

Critcal 5 over or under

3 actons per turn (ala pf2)

Saves based on class + level

Multiclass? Dual class? ad hoc class? Custom class?
Custom class makes the most sense. I know what people want.
    Class needs stamina and Mana, skill points, saves, abilities.
    Each class should have the same-ish number of skill points and the same total saves.

Damage should be static. No randomness?

I do like commited MP and MP shield
