Abilities
    Distinctive Physical Quirk: You have a unique physical aspect that is, well, bizarre. Depending on the setting, this can vary greatly. You might have purple hair or metal spikes on your head. Perhaps your hands don’t connect to your arms, although they move as if they do. Maybe a third eye stares out from the side of your head, or superfluous tendrils grow from your back. Whatever it is, your quirk might be a mutation, a supernatural trait (a blessing or curse), a feature with no explanation, or just a really wild tattoo that draws a lot of attention.
    - A Sense for the Weird: Sometimes—at the GM’s discretion—weird things relating to the supernatural or its effects on the world seem to call out to you. You can sense them from afar, and if you get within long range of such a thing, you can sense whether it is overtly dangerous or not.

    - Inability: People find you unnerving. All tasks relating to pleasant social interaction are hindered.
    - Healing Touch - With a touch, you restore 1d6 points to one stat Pool of any creature. This ability is a difficulty 2 Intellect task.

You may spend points out of your Ossuary instead of expending Might or Speed and may do so as a reaction. You may have a maximum number of points equal to the sum of your stat pools.
    - Wrap in Blood - You may spend 1d6 points out of your Ossuary to restore that much Might or Speed to a target.
    - Death Sight - You can perceive thanergy in the area around you. You can identify its source and learn its relative stregnth. This functions like detect magic, but only works for death energy. Enabler.

If you get a major effect, the creature attacking you takes 4 points of damage. Action to initiate.

Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of 10, a Might Edge of 1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the strength of a fit, capable adult human), and you can use it to move objects, push against objects, and so on. For example, you could lift and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3 m). This power lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it’s not a means of attack. You can’t use this ability on your own body. The power lasts for one hour or until its Might Pool is depleted, whichever comes first. Action. 
    - Dispel Magic - Int 3, You can temporarily dispel any magical effect within close range of level 4 or less. Each level of effort increases the level dispellable effects by 2.

Its physiology is remenesent of any creature's biology you are trained in (default is your own race). Each effort spent increases the constructs might pool by 5 and might edge by 1. The servent persists until it's might pool reaches 0 or you dismiss it. Its natural attacks are considered light. They improve to medium if you spend 2 effort and heavy if you spend 4. At 5 effort and above it can gain special abilities.

## Utility - Rituals
    Rituals do not typically cost any resources. They usually take 10 minutes to cast. A level of effort spent can decrease the time to 1 minute.

    - Mending - With a touch, you can repair a small object that is damaged (but not destroyed). If used on an object that has HP you can return 2 HP to the target. This ability is a difficulty 2 Intellect task. Each time you attempt to heal the same object, the task is hindered by an additional step.
