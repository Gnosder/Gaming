# Spells

## Summary

Spells have a Force (between 1 and 10), a school or category, Material Components (Verbal, Somatic, Material, Ritual), Target(s), Effect(s), Augmentation(s).

Spell effects can scale off CASTER level up to a maximum. Going over the maximum is called OVERCHARGING which most casters cannot do. Spells can be augmented up to their maximum by spending more mana. Spending mana beyond your capacity has a chance to invoke paradox.

Ranges: Spells have a range. These ranges are often standardized and are as follows:
    Close: 25ft + 5ft/ 2 caster levels
    Medium: 100ft + 10ft/caster level
    Long:

Augmentation: Unless a spell says otherwise each extra force increases the caster level by 1 (up to a maximum if one is listed).

### Constructs

Constructs have a variety of attributes: A CL (which determines how powerful it is), an intellect (mindless, brute, intellegent, aware), a source (arcane, necromantic, illusory, etc.), a role(what its supposed to do), and abilities or tricks (things it can do). 

Each spell or ritual that can create them details which attributes the construct has, but each construct works as detailed below.

A construct acting within its role has a bonus to actions equal to its creator's caster level. i.e. a blacksmithing golem with a CL of 3 gets +3 to all tests related to blacksmithing.


#### Construct intellegence

**Mindless:**
    Must be activly controlled. Can be 'programmed' to follow simple commands. A caster can dirct a mindless construct by using their own actions and concentrating on the task. A 'programmed' construct only performs the exact same task each time and has no bonus to its actions. Mindless constructs are capable of violence and can attack designated targets by default, however, mindless constrcts have no defense stat.  Progamming a Mindless construct takes 10 minutes per action the construct takes.

**Brute:**
    A brute construct is able to autonimously perform simple tasks without programming, but any variation of routine will cause it to stop functioning and require direction. Brute constructs can engage in combat on their own, however they're combat abilities are limited to simple actions.  A caster may direct a brute construct as one would a mentally deficient paeon.

**Intellegent:**
    These constructs have human level intellegence, though they lack creativity and intuition. They can be command and directed simply. They have an ability to problem solve, but cannot 'think outside the box' without assisstance. Constructs of this level may posses some memories or knowledge of their creator. They do not, however, know how to do anything their creator cannot do.

**Aware:** 
These constructs are "people" by many definitions of the word. They are intellegent and are possed of the same intuition and creativity that most beings are. They are for, all intents, Artificial Intellegence. These constructs can also be 'forks' or copies of their creator, having the same memory, knowledge, and personality.

#### Construct Role
**Worker Construct:**
The most simple type of construct. These have a job to do and they exist to do it. These jobs can be simple or complex (based on the constructs intellegence). The jobs is typically denoted at creation, but can be changed through programming. These constructs get a bonus to actions related to their task equal to their CL. All other tasks are performed at -8 (if they can be performed at all). This penalty can be reduced by higher intellegence (Brute -6, Intellegent -4, Aware -2).

**Combat Construct:**
A specialized type of worker construct these constructs are built for violence. They typically have built in weapons and attack abilities, but otherwise function as a worker constructs whos task is combat.

**Knowledge Construct:**
The most specialized type of construct, these are typically created with knowledge beyond what their creator has and have the ability to store and dispense contained knowledge. Intellegent constructs can act as mentors, but training under one takes twice as long as normal. These constructs can also be worker constructs if the creator desires (and the spell allows).

#### Default Construct Statistics
Health: Equal to double CL

Armor: 2

    Note: This armor comes from the fact that they have no sense of self preservation and do not feel pain. This value is reduce for each of those that is not true. Further this value can be adjusted based on what the construct is made from.

Task Bonus: Equal to CL

    Note: All non-task tests are a -8 for mindless, -6 for brute, -4 for intellegent, and -2 for aware intellegence.

Unarmed Damage: Equal to half CL (Round up)

### A

#### Alarm
- *School:* Abjuration
- *Cost:* 2
- *Material Components:* V, S, R
- *Range:* Close
- *Target:* 20ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space
- *Duration:* 2 hours/level
- *Save:* No

Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.

Mental Alarm: A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental “ping” that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.

Audible Alarm: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away.the sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing. Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the alarm.

Alarm can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

#### Animate Object
- *School:* Transmutation
- *Cost:* 9
- *Material Components:* V,S, (R)
- *Range:* Medium
- *Target:* One small object per CL.
- *Duration:* 1 round / level
- *Save:* No

You imbue inanimate objects with mobility and a semblance of life, creating mindless worker constructs. Each such animated object can then immediately attack whomever or whatever you initially designate. An animated object can be of any nonmagical material—wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, or the like. You may animate a number of Small or smaller objects (such as a chair) or an equivalent number of larger objects per caster level. A Medium object (such as a coat rack) counts as two Small or smaller objects, a Large object (such as a table) as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as sixteen, and a Colossal object as thirty-two. You can change the designated target or targets as a move action, as if directing an active spell. 

This spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature. 

Animate objects can be cast as a ritual reducing the cost to 5 and increases the duration to 1 day / level.
