## Abilities

Quick Learner: If you have no points in a non-combat skill, your first point spent gives you a score of +2 rather than +1. Further, silver and time costs to receive training are reduced by 25%.

Masterful Expertise: When using FP to reroll a failed non-combat skill check the FP is not spent if the second roll succeeds.

Rapid crafter: Able to create technologically advanced constructs. These constructs function as Brute constructs and last until destroyed. Cost and time to create TBD. Spend 3 mana to create a small contraption out of grit and whatever you have at hand, it lasts for one use or 1 minute before falling apart.

B.O.S.T.E.R. (Bo's Original Self Taught Engineering Robot): A small mechano-magical drone that grants +2 to any check it could aid with. Spend 4 mana to have B.O.S.T.E.R. enter combat mode for 3 rounds. In this mode it has 12 stamina, 2 armor, +6 defense and attacks with a flame thrower with +5 to hit and dealing 4 damage, this attack ignores cover and has a range of 15ft.

Berry Man: Cast Druidcraft at will, spend 2 mana to cast goodberry.
