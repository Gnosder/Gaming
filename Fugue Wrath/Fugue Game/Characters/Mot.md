## Abilities

Mana Efficiency: You gain a multiplier to your maximum MP equal to half your level rounded up.

Ley Lines: Spend 4 mana to connect to a natural ley line and create circle of power at your location. The circle lasts for 1 minute. While inside the circle you gain +2 to cast and spells cost 1 less mana. (2 actions)

Lucid Dreaming - If your mana is below 50% you recover twice as much mana from recovery rolls.

Enochian - You know Enochian, the language of angels and devils that spells ruin for those that hear it. Whenever you cast a spell you may speak Enochian which increases the spell's effcet by 1 level. However when you speak Enochian all creatures within long range can clearly hear you and understand, at least at a base level, what you are doing and to whom.
