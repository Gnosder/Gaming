# Fugue: Ex Ira

A sandbox campaign set in and around the kingdom of Gaxton during the height of the 4th age, located in Berin on Algos.

# Gaxton

The lone Kingdom of Berin. All that remains uncorrupted after the "Harbinger's Fall" calamity. The capital city Gaxton sits at the foot of Mount Hightower, a shard of Dalamur that protects the kingdom from Wrath. Gaxton is ruled by King Gundolf Hightower and his council of Lords. The kingdom is idylllic and peaceful and has everything it needs to function.

There are several factions in Gaxton that occasionally conflict.

## The Hightower

Led by King Gundolf Hightower the Hightowers guard the mountain against tampering, lest its protection falter. At once point it was known what the mountain was and why it was protecting the kingdom, but that knowledge was destroyed by King Rolf Hightower IV in his bid for autocratic control (The kingship is mostly seen as cerimonial). The current King, while he doesn't follow the Cult of the Hightower religion, is very protective of the mountain and views the wrath with suspicion and hostility.

## The Agency

A mostly secret organization that thinks the Wrath is similar to radioactive fallout and will disipate / be navigated. Wants to research the old world to find a way to leave the bubble and rebuild what was lost. Led by Lord Emme Murlur.

## Cult of the Hightower

A religious cult that appeared a generation after Rolf IV's failed attempt at autocrasy. They worship mount Hightower as a herald of the God of Light.

## Brotherhood of Stone

Remnants of the Firelash Clan of dwarves that made it under the protection of the dome before wrath destroyed them. Much of their ancestral knowledge was destroyed by Rolf IV.

## Whisper Leaf Sentinels

The few Elves that survived the destruction of their forest home by Mount Hightower. They attempted to assist the people of Gaxton in rebuilding, but were mostly killed by Rolf IV (those that survived have not forgotten). They now keep to themselves, but some can hear the voice of their late Monarch King Llewan calling to them from beneath Hightower.
