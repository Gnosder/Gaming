# Gridania
Ruins as found in the 4th age.

Ancient trees infested with wrath. Feels like a war between wrath and nature. Nature has lost.
The buildings are ruined and almost unnoticeable save for a few.

Haunted by Voidsent and wrath zombies. Seedseer Kan-e-sena still lives in the conjurer's guild, but will not leave (the elements need him to fight back the wrath).

### Apkallu Cistern

A small cave beneath the falls contains a shimmering portal into a cistern. A Void Sent named Maladragus has moved into it. Maladragus uses Wrath Light as well Void Energy. (The Void Sent have embraced the wrath).

#### Area 1 - Apkallu Shrine.
    Once upon a time this was a hidden shrine to the water elemental known as Apkallu. It has since been desecrated (Apkallu is dead) and the sacred pool of water is a portal into the cistern. The cave is empty other than a low altar before the pool. Sconces on the wall hold biolumenecent moss.

#### Area 2 - The Roiling Cistern
    Light: None
    The only way into the cistern is to submerge and swim in the sacred pool that is now a portal. The water becomes turbulent once through the portal and the sediment and weeds at the bottom of the cistern are hostile. They will attack as a constrictor trap and attempt to restrain and drown the characters, they are not intellegent and are animated by angry elemental energeis.
        Water Hazard: Attack 14 or grappled/immobalized/drowning. HP 6. Attacks while underwater have disadvantage.

#### Area 3 - Misty Moor
    Light: None*
    After leaving the water characters find themselves surrounded by a dense fog. Will'o'wisps can be seen flikering in the distance (the lights lead into quicksand that animates into an earth elemental that tries to smother characeters).
    The moor leads to area 4 and 5.

### Area 4 - The unquite earth
    Light: Shimmering energy, dim
    A cave that is constantly shaken by siesmic events. Bolders fall from the roof and are absorbed by the ground. Void Light and Wrath can be seen swirling in through the air. The elements are batteling the void, but is losing and cannot tell friend from foe. The Void will manifest as imps and a hell hound while the elements assault everyone with falling stones and dangerous terrain.

### Area 7 - The Altar of Maladragus
    Light: Well lit by 4 magical orbs on the walls
    The void sent Maladragus has created a funnel it is using to siphon power from the elements in the area.

### Area 5 -

    A small cave of elemental power. A greater earth Elemental lives there and leads the elements against the void. It will defend itself, but will aid anyone that can convince it they are against the void or carries the mark of the seedseer.

### Area 6 -
