# Dusk Bastards
## Powered by Cypher

A system of Struggle and Discovery.
Actions have position and effect (ala blades in the Dark) and uses Cypher's core system. Unlike with cypher your chosen focus is more similar to a Job in FF14 and progress seperately from core level (which just governs stats, skills, and feats).
