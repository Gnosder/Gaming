# Systems

## Basic Action Resolution

All actions and defenses work the same. You will roll a d20 and add any bonuses or penalties. You compare your result against a difficulty class (DC) set by the GM.

    In the case of a skill test you will add your skill bonus to your roll. For a melee attack you will add your melee attack bonus (mBAB). To save against a dragon's fire breath you'll add your reflex save. To defend against an orc's greataxe you'll roll your defense.

Some actions, like dealing damage, neccesitate an aditional roll, typically from a smaller die like a d6, d8, or d10. Just like before you'll add any bonuses and penalties.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Most of the time you'll be adding static bonuses to your actions, but sometimes your action may be particularly well suited to succeed or fail. In these cases you may have advantage or disadvantage. In the case of advantage you will roll 2d20 (instead of one) and choose the highest of the two. Disadvantage works the same except you choose the lowest of the two.

If you have both advantage and disadvantage on a roll the two cancel each other out. If you would have multiple instances of advantage, they each grant +2 to your roll (or -2 in the case of disadvantage).

### Critical Successes and Failures

In all tests if you roll 5 over the DC you critically succeed, whereas if you roll 5 under the DC you critically fail. The effects of such rolls are determined by the action.

### Group tests and Actions

There are times when multiple individuals work together to attempt an action. Perhaps they are all searching a room together or they are all helping with first aid.
In those instances everyone rolls the check and it only fails if more than half the participants fail. Further if a degree of success is needed then it is the second highest roll that passed. While making a group test you may spend FP for allies to reroll their checks if your bonus on the test is higher.

### Opposed Tests

Some actions don't have a set DC to challenge, but rather go against another individual. In those instances both characters will roll their for their actions and the one who rolls higher wins. For the purposes of criticals just treat the lower roll as the DC.

## General Actions

### Resting

All characters need rest. Rests come in 2 primary varieties, helpfully called a Short Rest and a Long Rest. Short rests are quick breathers while Long Rests are generally sleep.

#### Short Rests

A Short Rest takes 1 hour of time. During a Short Rest character's regain all their lost Stamina and they may be able to refresh any abilities or tools. During a Short Rest a character can repair or examine a single item or attune to a single magical item.

#### Long Rests

A Long Rest takes 8 hours of time and no more than one may be taken in a single day. Long Rests typically require characters to spend the majority of the rest sleeping though this can be broken up (for example by taking turns at keeping watch) though any strenuous effort can spoil the effects of the rest. During a Long Rest a character may refresh FP (based on how they are resting) and may attempt to recover from a wound. Further characters that do not take a Long Rest each day are at risk of Fatigue.

### Stamina, Wounds, and Fatigue

#### Stamina
Stamina represents a character's ability to avoid and mitigate harm. Its a measure of close calls, bruses, and fleshwounds. While it can be thought of as health and losing it can be thought of as damage it is less corporeal than that. Stamina recovers fully after an hour of rest, though some conditions such as mana burn can impead this recovery. When a character's stamina reaches 0 they receive a wound and then "Rally" recoving half their maximum stamina. Maximum stamina is determined by a character's class and their constitution.

#### Wounds
Wounds are real damage where as stamina is bumps and scrapes. When a character takes a wound they are taking a persistant amount of damage that harms their ability to act. When a wound is taken the gm rolls a d10 to find the wound's severity and give it an appropriate name. The value is never told to the players, but can be determined with a treat wounds check or similar. When the total value of a character's wounds meets or exceeds their death score (13) they are dying.

##### Wound Severity and Effects
Wounds are contextual and each effects a character in a different way. There are, however, some simple guidelines.
In general a wound of severity 1-3 imposes a -1 penalty around once a scene, a wound of severity 4-7 imposes a -2 penalty once every minute, and any wound of a severity greater than 7 imposes a -4 penalty every round.

##### Permanent Wounds
Some wounds are permanent such as severed limbs and others only heal partially leaving a scar or lingering effects.
In general wounds received by critically failing a defense or by not defending at all have a 50% chance to be permanent while wounds that heal have a 10% chance of leaving a scar or mark and a lesser chance of having lingering effects.

##### Recovering Wounds
Wounds heal slowly over time. Some wounds heal faster than others while some never heal. More serious wounds require a stricter regimene of rest than less serious wounds. At the end of each time period a character can attempt to recover from a wound. If they met the required rest for the wound's severity they make a con save against the wound's severity + 5. If they pass the severity reduces by 1. Once a wound's severity reaches 0 it is considered healed.

| Wound Severity | Time to reduce severity | Rest Required |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Minor (1-3)    | 1 Day                   | Light Work    |
| Moderate (4-7) | 1 Week                  | Low Stress    |
| Severe (8+)    | 1 Month                 | Bed Rest      |

#### Death, Dying, and the death score
Each character has a base death score of 13. When their total wound scores reach that value they are dying. Dying characters are incapacitated and cannot move or act. Further they receive a wound called "Mortally Wounded" with a value of 1d6 each round they remain dying. When they reach a death score 10 over their base (23 by default) they die. A character with medicine can "Spare the dying" to try and stabalize a dying character and there exists some powerful magic that can stabalize or even restore a dying character.

#### Fatigue

There are instances where characters can not act at thier best -- perhaps they haven't eaten in a while, or they've been awake for too long, or maybe dark magic is sapping their vitality -- regardless we call those times fatigue. When a character suffers Fatigue their maximum stamina is reduced. If a character's maximum stamina ever reaches 0 they begin to die. In order to remove fatigue the underlying cause must be dealt with. If the fatigue is casued by starvation the character must eat, etc.
    Mana Burn is another type of fatigue and works the same way except that it cannot be healed by anything but time.

### Mana and Magic

#### Mana
Mana is a shorthand for the myriad magical powers that infuses the world and the beings who inhabit it. Each tradition has different names for mana -- vis, thanergy, will -- they all work fundamentally the same. Mana is a resource that regenerates over time and allows mortals to use magic and shape the world. For most characters their maximum mana is equal to their magic.
Mana recovers by 1d4 every hour. Some items (such as tass) have the ability to restore mana on demand.

## Exploration and Navigation

Exploration, being one of the three pillars of role playing games is fairly straight forward, but requires some understanding of terms.

### The Exploration Turn -- Travel and Delving

There are two ways to track time while exploring, the Watch and the Turn.
Watches are used while traveling and can be thought of as "overworld" movement. They are roughly 4 hours long which means a standard day is broken up into 6 watches.
Turns are used while "delving" or exploring an area in detail. This can be thought of as "dungeon" movement. Turns are roughly 1 hour long which means a standard day is broken up into 24 turns.

It's important to remember that no method of keeping time is 100% accurate and some amount of leeway is generally understood. There are also actions that can take less than a turn or a watch, such as searching a room or landmark, in those cases the GM will arbitrate how time passes.

#### Sidebar - Terms

It may seem like a lot of terminology is used and it is. However, you don't have to remember it all. Just be aware of how the GM breaks time up.

### Travel

An average character or animal can travel 2 watches a day without much effort. Traveling a third risks Fatigue and traveling more than that gaurantees it.

## Social

While one of the three primary pillars social interactions are the least well defined and are best understood through best practices rather than concrete rulings. There are many types of social interactions, fortunatley most of friendly and do not require many rules (if any). There exists, however, a common social interaction, also known as a social conflict, that benefits from some concrete systems.

    Note: One important thing to remember is that social skills are not magic (unless you are using magic) and can't make the impossible happen.

### Social Conflicts

Often started when one party seeks out the other to ask for a boon. Be it information, money, magic, titles, or permission. This conflict is not unlike combat, but takes a very different form. The party asking for the boon is the petitioner and the other is the granter. In combat we would call them the aggressor and the defender.

While combat plays out in rounds, social conflicts do not. They can span any length of time, though minutes or hours are most common. When a social conflict begins use the following guidelines to resolve it.
    - Set party attitudes by comparing the reputations of the groups
    - Optional: Small talk
    - Based on the ask and the attitude determine a relative difficulty
    - Add any conditions to modify the DC
    - Compare DC to Reputation + conditions
    Note: While player characters have a reputation value and quality they are not required to follow these guidlines and are free to accept, reject, or negotiate any boons asked of them. This is called player agency.

Reputations are scored starting at 0 (unknown). They have a value and a quality (e.g. 9 heroism). The value is related to the strength of their reputation and is calculated based on deeds, wealth, titles, land, and contacts. Quality, on the otherhand, reflects the greatest parts of their reputation (i.e. what they are known for). 
    When 2 parties meet they compare their reputations (though only what they know of the other. e.g. if they haven't heard of the other their reputation is 0). If this is the first time they've met, they determine first impressions. Otherwise, they use their knowledge of the other (i.e. if they have met before they may have a different view than the general one).

Once both reputations are known a starting attitude can be determined. Generally if the reputation qualities of the two parties do not conflict they can start at friendly or neutral, otherwise they start at unfriendly or even hostile.
    Note: Some parties may determine their attitude before reputations are known (e.g. someone who hates gnomes might automatically start as unfriendly to a gnome regardless of reputation).

Once the ask is made a difficulty can be calculated. This is the sum of the attitude DC, the ask DC, and any temporary boons one might have.
    Small Talk: You can engage in small talk before hand. Pleasure before business. If you do roll persuasion against their attitude DC. If you pass you reduce the ask DC by 2 otherwise you increase it by 2.

If your reputation is higher than the ask DC you succeed and get what you wanted otherwise you do not. If you don't get what you want, all is not lost. Though success may cost you. You can offer gifts, make demands, or threaten the other party. This will modify your reputation for the negotiation and can influence your reputation with that party in the future. The three tables below lay out those DCs.
    Note: No roll is made here. It's a comparison of who you are and what you are offering versus who they are and what you are asking for.
    Note: Hostile parties may attack if negotiations fail.
