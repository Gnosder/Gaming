# Systems

## Basic Action Resolution

All actions and defenses work the same. You will roll a d20 and add any bonuses or penalties. You compare your result against a difficulty class (DC) set by the GM.

    In the case of a skill test you will add your skill bonus to your roll. For a melee attack you will add your melee attack bonus (mBAB). To save against a dragon's fire breath you'll add your reflex save. To defend against an orc's greataxe you'll roll your defense.

Some actions, like dealing damage, neccesitate an aditional roll, typically from a smaller die like a d6, d8, or d10. Just like before you'll add any bonuses and penalties.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Most of the time you'll be adding static bonuses to your actions, but sometimes your action may be particularly well suited to succeed or fail. In these cases you may have advantage or disadvantage. In the case of advantage you will roll 2d20 (instead of one) and choose the highest of the two. Disadvantage works the same except you choose the lowest of the two.

If you have both advantage and disadvantage on a roll the two cancel each other out. If you would have multiple instances of advantage, they each grant +2 to your roll (or -2 in the case of disadvantage).

### Critical Successes and Failures

In all tests if you roll 5 over the DC you critically succeed, whereas if you roll 5 under the DC you critically fail. The effects of such rolls are determined by the action.

### Group tests and Actions

There are times when multiple individuals work together to attempt an action. Perhaps they are all searching a room together or they are all helping with first aid.
In those instances everyone rolls the check and it only fails if more than half the participants fail. Further if a degree of success is needed then it is the second highest roll that passed. While making a group test you may spend FP for allies to reroll their checks if your bonus on the test is higher.

## Exploration and Navigation

Exploration, being one of the three pillars of role playing games is fairly straight forward, but requires some understanding of terms.

### The Exploration Turn

There are two ways to track time while exploring, the Watch and the Turn.
A turn is roughly 1 hour long while a watch, being the larger of the two, is roughly 4 hours long. This means most standard days break up into 6 watches or 24 turns.
Turns are typically used to track durations and effects like spells and light sources while watches are typically used to track overland travel and exploration actions.

While exploring the GM may roll lots of dice. This is nothing to worry about. Everything is perfectly fine. You're not about to get eaten by a Gru.

## Social

While one of the three primary pillars social interactions are the least well defined and are best understood through best practices rather than concrete rulings. There are many types of social interactions, fortunatley most of friendly and do not require many rules (if any). There exists, however, a common social interaction, also known as a social conflict, that benefits from some concrete systems.

    Note: One important thing to remember is that social skills are not magic (unless you are using magic) and can't make the impossible happen.

### Social Conflicts

Often started when one party seeks out the other to ask for a boon. Be it information, money, magic, titles, or permission. This conflict is not unlike combat, but takes a very different form. The party asking for the boon is the petitioner and the other is the granter. In combat we would call them the aggressor and the defender.

While combat plays out in rounds, social conflicts do not. They can span any length of time, though minutes or hours are most common. When a social conflict begins use the following guidelines to resolve it.
    - Set party attitudes by comparing the reputations of the groups
    - Optional: Small talk
    - Based on the ask and the attitude determine a relative difficulty
    - Add any conditions to modify the DC
    - Compare DC to Reputation + conditions
    Note: While player characters have a reputation value and quality they are not required to follow these guidlines and are free to accept, reject, or negotiate any boons asked of them. This is called player agency.

Reputations are scored starting at 0 (unknown). They have a value and a quality (e.g. 9 heroism). The value is related to the strength of their reputation and is calculated based on deeds, wealth, titles, land, and contacts. Quality, on the otherhand, reflects the greatest parts of their reputation (i.e. what they are known for). 
    When 2 parties meet they compare their reputations (though only what they know of the other. e.g. if they haven't heard of the other their reputation is 0). If this is the first time they've met, they determine first impressions. Otherwise, they use their knowledge of the other (i.e. if they have met before they may have a different view than the general one).

Once both reputations are known a starting attitude can be determined. Generally if the reputation qualities of the two parties do not conflict they can start at friendly or neutral, otherwise they start at unfriendly or even hostile.
    Note: Some parties may determine their attitude before reputations are known (e.g. someone who hates gnomes might automatically start as unfriendly to a gnome regardless of reputation).

Once the ask is made a difficulty can be calculated. This is the sum of the attitude DC, the ask DC, and any temporary boons one might have.
    Small Talk: You can engage in small talk before hand. Pleasure before business. If you do roll persuasion against their attitude DC. If you pass you reduce the ask DC by 2 otherwise you increase it by 2.

If your reputation is higher than the ask DC you succeed and get what you wanted otherwise you do not. If you don't get what you want, all is not lost. Though success may cost you. You can offer gifts, make demands, or threaten the other party. This will modify your reputation for the negotiation and can influence your reputation with that party in the future. The three tables below lay out those DCs.
    Note: No roll is made here. It's a comparison of who you are and what you are offering versus who they are and what you are asking for.
    Note: Hostile parties may attack if negotiations fail.

* Intimidation will, after the negotiation concludes, result in least a negative quality being gained

### Reputation

Anytime you interact with anyone you are building a reputation. All reputations have a value and one or more qualities ot tags that describe the reputation.
While you can have a general reputation that can follow you, you can also have a reputation with individuals that might be different. For example, you may be a generally good person who helps others so your overall reputation may be "5, kind" but to someone who doesn't like you it might be "2, bragart". In general a person's specific thoughts overrule your general reputation, but there are exceptions to that. For example, if you're in public someone may treat you according to your full reputation, but in private they may treat you differently.
