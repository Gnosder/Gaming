# Loot

Throughout their adventures characters will collect a plethora of unique and different items. These come in several broad catagories: Equipment (that which can be used) both mundane and magical, Treasure (gems, coins, art, and jewlrey), titles (names and deeds), and property. Mundane equipment was covered in the previous chapter. This chapter will focus on magical items, treasure, titles, and property.

## Treasure

### Sidebar: Money and Value
Trade bars: Sometimes metal is cast in bars of standard weights. A 2 lb bar is worth 100 coins of its metal and a 5lb bar is worth 250 coins.

### Sidebar: Sellling Loot
Selling loot can be a time consuming process which usually entails trips to many different businesses to find buyers. It talkes a full day to sell loot, which entails visiting numerous shops and haggelling. At the end of the day the GM will generate a list of the prices people are willing to pay for each item and the character selling them can decide to sell each item or keep it.

### Coins
The value of a coin is typically denoted by its metal content and size. However they can have different values in different areas. Further, some coins hold special value to collectors and historians.

### Goods
Goods is a broad category but typically refers to 'trade goods' or items that are typically traded. This can be in food, water, spices, raw materias such a wood, metal, or cloth. This can also be finished goods such as furnature. Goods can be perishable, meaning they rot relativly quickly, decaying meaning they lose some potency with time but may not be useless, and timeless where only extreme time can damage them.

### Gems and Art
Whereas goods are used to meet needs, art exists to create culture. Art generally increases in value the older it is.

## Titles
Titles are given in recognition of deeds, inherited from family, purchased, even even given to oneself. They come in many forms and as many places. Every region of every world has their own customs and norms around the giving and receiving of titles.
In general titles themselves mean very little on their own, but they can mean a great deal to the people or culture that imparted it. Being called the "Savior of Havenshire" may not mean much 1000 miles from havenshire, but to the citizens of havenshire it probably means a great deal. 
Reputations and privlages are much the same. They tend to only matter to those they are about or impact. All that is to say that its not possible to make a list of possible titles. 
### Reputations
Whenever you interact
### Privlages
### Sample Titles

## Property
Thoughout their careers characters can gain property which generally falls into two categories: Luxery and Commercial. Luxery properties exist for prestige and comfort, these a things like apartments, villas, and palaces. Commercial property on the other hand is anything that can generate income like stores, mines, businesses.
Characters can also make investsments in businesses and ventures. While similar to commercial property in that investsments generate income they are almost always independent of the characters (meaning there is little they can do to influence them), Investsments generally 
### Luxery Property
Luxery Property has 2 main game benefits: the first is establishing and enhancing ones lifestyle, the second is granting downtime and rest bonuses.

If a person rests in a nice place they can get bonuses to FP refresh, temporary  stamina, temporary mana, short duration consumables, grit or even more. All these bonuses fade the next time you take a long rest.

#### Lifestyle
Everyone who lives needs a place to do it. Add to that food, water, cloting, and the other necceities that make life worth living and you have a great many needs that need to be met. All that together is called Lifestyle and its broken up into brackets.
