# Cheat Sheet

## Actions
### Critical Success and Failure
If a role beats a DC by 5 or more it is a critical success.
If a role fails by 5 or more it is a critical failure.
    - Critical attacks do +3 damage
    - Critical attack failures allow the creature to counterattack with shock damage
    - Critical Defense does shock damage
    - Critical Defense failure does +3 damage
### Advantage and Disadvantage
roll 2d20 and choose the highest / lowest
Multiple instances cancel 1:1
If any are left gain +2 / -2 each

### Group Test
Everyone rolls and the group fails only if more than half the participants fail.
Cannot critically succeed.
Critial Fail if everyone fails.

## Magic

### Spontaneous
    - Choose the spell you wish to cast
    - Set the force for the spell, up to twice your magic.
        All spells have a base force required and most have additional effects with more.
    - Choose targets for the spell
    - Cast Spell
        Determine Effect; rolling to hit as needed
        Spend 1d4 mana per force, save vs. Drain for half
        On failed save: Roll for Paradox if Force > your Magic
    - Determine Ongoing (penalty to further spell casting)
        Each spell sustained incures a -2 penalty to all further actions.

## Ritual Casting
    - Choose a Ritual Leader
    - Choose the Ritual (the leader must know it)
    - Choose Force (Max twice the leader's magic)
        All rituals have a base force required and most have additional effects with more.
    - Create Circle
        Unless otherwise specified a simple circle of chalk or dirt is sufficient.
    - Perform Sacrifice (If the ritual requires one)
    - Perform the Ritual (Determine the effect of the ritual)
    - Save vs. Drain (each participant does so seperately, though they may use the leader's save instead of their own)
        Mana cost is distriuted evenly among all participants

## Enchanting

Enchaning is the process of embuing magic into items allowing the enchanter to create wands, staves, potions, and other magic items. The process is as follows:
    - Choose Formula of the item to be created
    - Set Force equal to magic
    - Choose Item to be enchanted
    - Expend Resources
    - Test Skill (vs. creation DC): Tinker + Magic vs DC
    - Save vs. Drain
