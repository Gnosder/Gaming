# Cheat Sheet

## Magic
### Spontaneous
    - Choose the spell you wish to cast
    - Set the force for the spell, up to twice your magic.
        All spells have a base force required and most have additional effects with more.
    - Choose targets for the spell
    - Cast Spell
        Determine Effect; rolling to hit as needed
        Spend 1d4 mana per force, save vs. Drain for half
        Roll for Paradox if Force > your Magic
    - Determine Ongoing (penalty to further spell casting)
        Each spell sustained incures a -2 penalty to all further actions.
