## Ruination and Wrath

The world of Algos is struck by calamity and cataclysm more times than one would think possible. Several of the largest are named. The numbers represent the order in which they occured.

### The Darkening (3) (Chaos Introduced)

A sorcery gone awry tore a hole in reality and created the "Algian Gate" from which Outsiders and other Eldritch beings emerged. The gate also lead to the Dark Water that consumed the Ink Sea. The war that followed destroyed the old Skov Empire and "burned" the sky leaving a permanent cloud cover over the northern reaches that blocks out all sunlight (except during high storms). The gate is closed, but not locked.

### Wrath of the Maker (2) (Arcane Introduced)

(creates the high storms)
While primal magic transformed much of Algos into a paradise on the far away island nation of Zratcha it was also used for war. The magic was wielded by elementally infused "God-sorcerers" and was the source of much destruction. At the pinicle of the "Primalist War" a divinity known only as the "Maker" arrived on Algos. He took the primal magics the sorcerers wielded and wove it into a great tapestry called the "Storm's Cowl". The cowl destroyed Zratcha in a massive storm, the first of the High Storms, and flooded the world with Arcane magic. High storms are common on the "Storm Side" of the cascades and contain within them great amounts of mana.

### The Deliverance (1) (Primal Introduced)

(Creates the floating islands in the sea of giants)
Ten thousand years ago, or so the stories say, a great battle was waged in the heavens above the world. At its end a shard of pure creation, the remnants of a slain God, fell into the southern sea and formed the great Maelstrom. The maelstrom began to create floating islands with strange monsters, but it also released the primal magic into the world.


### Harbinger's Fall (4)

A thousand years ago one of Algos' moons fell to the world. But what should have been an extinction level event was stopped when the moon's decent was suddenly halted over the Twin Fang Mountains. The moon is still there, sliently floating in place above the mountains. A city was carved into the stone by cultists worshiping the moon, but it is now a ruin. While the moon did not impact the planet it had a devestating effect on Algian tides.

## Continents

### The Cascades

A long contiguous landmass named after its many massive mountain ranges; the geatest of which "the Spine" runs from upper Berin down to the southern most tip of Jurai. A number of mountain ranges spiral off from the the Spine and are known as "The Ribs"; the greatest of these are used to demark the three major regions (Berin, Kevros, Jurai).

#### Berin, Upper Cascade

Temperate to Cold environment similar to IRL Canada. The north eastern side is a rocky, storm blasted area known as the "Ghost Lands" in which the city of Duskvol thrives.

#### Kevros, Middle Cascade

Ranging from Cold Temperate to Tropical, Kevros is the most diverse of the cascades and is home to an incedible number of Kingdoms, indepenent states, and nomadic peoples.

#### Jurai, Lower Cascade

A land on and south of the equator Jurai is mostly tropical and heavily forested. Though deserts are common on the "still side".


## Oceans

### The Ink Sea

A cataclysm known as "the Darkening of Algos" or simply "dark water" is spreading from an unkown point in the arctic. This turns the sea Ink black and warps the creatures living in it. Eldrich Leviathans call the sea their home. It is spreading into the Tumult on the east and held back bt the Barrier Sea to the west.

### The Barrier Sea

A great artifical reef spans the point where this sea and the ink sea meet. Ancient pylons constructed on the reef produce an unknown magic which holds the advance of the ink sea at bay. Despite the calmness of the sea, the reef has yet to be fully mapped making passage through the sea treacherous. A large kingdom of Sahagin prevents anyone fro sailing too far west.

### Sea of Giants

Massive islands dot this sea and move with the current. It is believed that the islands are created (and eventualy consumed) by an elemental vortex in the antarcrtic region, but no one has ever made it back from there to tell for sure. Strange and unknown mosters dot these islands (ala Dauntless) making the islands dangerous to explore.

### The Tumult

LIttle is known about this vast body of water save that massive Storms, High Storms, blow in from the east. These storms are typically broken by the Spine, but some make it over the mountains. Life on the Tumult side is rough (see Stormlight Archives). Legends tell of the island nation of Zratcha and the great war that happened there which created the storms.

## Other Features

### Sigmarl Islands

Interspersed among the reefs of the Barrier sea are a large collection of volcanic islands (Hawaii and FF10). This area is mostly safe, although a massive leviathan referred to as "Sin of Dahlmar" often torments the area.
