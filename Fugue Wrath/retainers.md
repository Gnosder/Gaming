Share: Share is a semi-easy way to determine wages when the propery value is very high. (An accountant who oversees 1,000,000sp wouldn't accept 200sp wages). Take the wages (usually 2-3% of the property) and divide it by the total number of shares to find how much each share is worth. Multiply that by the retainer's share cost to find how much they are owed monthly.

## Property

Properties have a value (in SP), a reputation, and a type.

Value: Is how much the property is worth and has an effective value and an actual value.
    Actual value is the amount of money put into it (not counting construction costs)
    Effective value is the actual value multiplied by relevant retainers
Reputation: Refers to how others view the property AND those who live/work there
Type: Whether it is a manor, castle, fief, etc.
