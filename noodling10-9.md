What is the issue that plauges the Grand Alliance of Alexander?
First off, the city is named "The Grand Alliance of Alexander" and it is really 13 cities that were built around the colossus Alexander and gradually mergered together into one megacity.

The government is a soverign aristocracy. There are 13 houses and one is chosen to lead the Alliance. There are a few methods for doing so, though none are well enforced. Becoming the High Chair is more political manuevers than fiat.

Currently there are 5 major houses and 8 minor houses. House Thestus is the current High Chair, though their patriarch, William Thestus III, has just died. The current heir is only 9, so a prohoc Monarch is ruling in her place; Queen Regent Justisha Thestus. Of the 12 other houses most are doubling their efforts to curry favor and increase their clout when the dust settles. Further, House Thestus has ruled longer than most and under the 'old laws' a house may challenge them for control. House Thestus thus far has refused all challenges using various excuses. The old recourse is a war for succession, though a proxy or challenge war might be used. The politics are intense.

House Thestus, Great House of Colossus Smiths
    Current High Chair. Led by Queen Regent Justisha Thestus in the stead of her daughter Queen Expectant Elizabeth Thestus IV.
    They no longer know how to build the colossi, though they pretend otherwise. They're supposed to be maintaining Alexander.
    They've had control of the high chair for 3 succesions (William II, William III, Justisha I)
House Ala Mhigo, Great House of Valourous Heroes
    Staunch supporters of House Thestus. Queen Justisha is the niece of Rabal Mhigo, the current patriarch.
    "Heroes don't rule, they lead"
House Garlemald, Great House of Kings
    Still upset they lost the high chair to House Thestus. THey've held it more often than most of the others combined and see it as their right.
    Even more upset that Justisha annuled the mariage of Elizabeth Thestus and Zevos Garlemald.
    They're doing their best (which is very good) to take back the High chair
House Fortemps, Great House of the Rose Knight
    They don't really want the high chair and don't care who fills it. House Fortemps oversees most of the military and logistics of protecting the city. Their primarch, the ancient Elf Haurchefant Fortemps, takes his role as the Rose Knight very seriously. He is also a Warder.
    THeir primary concern is the protection of Alexander
House Doma, Great House of Storms
    House Doma is situated atop a platue that straddles the river Grand Majesty. Primary seaborn comerce. They own the port on the crystal shores and have a seat in the Free Raider's thasylocracy. They're seen as cunning traders and pirates with no eyes on the high chair, however the current matriarch, Glory of the Great Reef, is seeing this as the time for Doma to take the chair.
    The newest great house. Started as merchants and pirates.

House Garlond, House of Inventions
    Home to Cid Garlond and the Garlond Steelworks, the premier inventor of the realm.
    He's been studying Colossus metals and construction. A new house, Cid was a member of House Garlemald before he 'defected' and started his own house.
House Santos, House of Grain
    Used to be a great house, but the previous patriarch pissed it away. They're trying to get back.
House Fey, House of Magic
    Enchanters and Sorcerers. Fluctuates between wicked witches and mad scholars.


Warder's Circle
A secret area within Alexander where the Warders conduct business and research. The circle has a comprehensive library and full workshops for all/most trades. As lightbringers they will be offered full access to the circle as well as granted any needed resources (though the circle is not wealthy). The circle exists queitly and doesn't amass wealth or anything that might give them away. Officially they're one of the many evening clubs of the city (toast masters or free masons).
The leader of the Warders is The Speaker, a Cleric of the Walker who can occasionally interface with colossi, though it has become rarer in recent years. The Speaker will recognize the lightbringers immediately and will attempt to enlist their aid.

### Quest
Awaken the colossi to purge the realm of the corruption. If needed cleanse the colossi if they have been corrupted. Find Alexander's spark housing in Yalt (the speaker is trying to narrow down where in the city it is). Use the awakened colossi to empower ALexnader's spark.

## In Play
The state of affairs when the LIghtbringers enter the city.
They will have no clout or claim to city politics. They will most likely head right tot he Warder circle.
The speaker will give them their quest and help the plan their moves.


## Quests and Rewards and Boons
Quests come in multiple flavors.
- Main/Campaign: This is the main quest
- Regional: These are major quests and often tie into the main quest
- Side: This are non-trival requests made of the players
- Goal/Whim: These are simple quests used to 'carrot' the players in the right direction

Rewards are just as important as quests, if not more so. A good reward should be something the players want and/or can use.

Potential rewards:
Gold - what to spend it on?
Exp - Heck yeah, everyone wants it
Consumables - can be useful but some people don't use them (though they should)

What do I need to have done in order to run the game?
Everyone needs a character sheet.
I need a scene or something for each area
    Perhaps a small graphic and notes?

Game 'balance'? 
Action economy: 1 action, 1 movement, 1 bonus action, 1 reaction
Each combat should tax vitality to limit, but not quite hit wounds if smart.
damage per round should be ~4 for NPCs per player? Or should it be more deadly?
Need ability to buy more vit?
