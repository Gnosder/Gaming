# Rotes

Rotes are pre-made spells that can be learned. They are cheaper but less flexible than improvised casting. Rotes typically give a discount to mana cost and can do other things such as reduced paradox or increased effect. Rotes typically have static effects and don't scale with DoS.

Emergency Shield: Target self; Range touch; Duration 1 round; Casting Abort; Gain sheild 5.
    Cost: 1 mana.
