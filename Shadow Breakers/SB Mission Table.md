# SB Mission Table

Essentially taking the war tables from WoW (sending followers out on quests) and implementing them in an RPG. Followers would have a Tier, a Rating, a Role, and an ability. They would also require downtime between missions. You would send a handful of followers on a mission (along with some gold for supplies and wages) and they would report back (if they survive).
