### Condition

This covers stress, willpower, spirit, victories, and wounds.

#### Stress

A double tracker which records the max value on top and the current value below.
The starting value is 7.
Current stress is also used for physical saves.
Each time stress falls to 0, take a wound and refill to new max. Each wound reduces max stress by 3, minimum 1.

#### Victories

Each challenge overcome counts as a victory. Each victory adds +1 to certain rolls. There are 3 thresholds that grant bonus to all rolls. On a long rest, victories turn into experience and 0 out.

## Magic Sheet

### Mana

A magic user has 2 mana bars. The first, Spirit, is the same as a normal person. It's the power of their soul. They largely do not have control over it or how much power it stores. The second, Aura, is the power they draw from the world around them.

### Tradition

A character's tradition is where their training lies. Whether it be Hermetic, Shamanistic, Monastic, Divine, etc. It is largely narrative, but tradition does determine Focus and Bane.

Focus is the traditions primary school(s) (of the 10) and grants a bonus to spells of that school. While a bane is a weakness or taboo school(s) that impose a penalty. This bonus/penalty applies BOTH to rolls and experience spent to learn spells that include that school. If a spell would grant both a bonus and a penalty, it instead imposes a penalty.

#### The 10

There are 10 schools of magic broken up into major and minor schools. Major schools are: Prime, Life, Entropy, Matter, and Space. The Minor schools are: Fate, Time, Spirit, Forces, and Mind. The major schools are seen as the fundamental aspects of reality while the minor schools are created by the major. In practice this distinction does not make an appriable difference.

### Techniques

There are 5 accepted techniques to the casting and shaping of magic. Creation, Perception, Transformation, Destruction, and Control. Each technique's use is contextual to the school being used. Creation of life and time are different.

When learning Rote spells gain an exp discount if the LOWEST technique is higher than the spell level. When casting ad hoc spells, use the LOWEST technique to determine bonuses.

### Magical Merits

Some merits apply to the use of magic and are best recorded here for reference.

### Rote Spells

While it is possible to cast magic spontaneously, this is usually a poor idea. Instead learning discreat spells allows for the most efficient use of mana and the greatest application of power. (Rote spells are limited to do what they say, but are more powerful. While spontaneous spells are highly flexible, but weaker).

Can only learn Rote spells if one of the techniques used is equal to or higher level than the spell. Rote spells can be learned with experience or downtime. Simply using a spontaneous spell repeatidly can lessen the cost in xp or time, but cannot remove it completly.

### Spontaneous Modifiers

For the desparate mage. These

## Inventory Sheet

### Bulk

Each item has a bulk which is a rough sum of it's weight and size. Worn items often take up less (usually -2, min 1).

### Money

Money comes in many differet forms. The general idea is 1,000 coins count as 1 Bulk whereas 10,000 bills count as 1 bulk.
Currency usuall follows the general format:

    Base Currency (Dollar, Silver piece)
    Subdivion of base currency (cents, copper piece) (Sometimes further divided)
    Large denomination (100 dollar, gold piece)
    Trade (check, trade bar). Checks can be for any value, trade bars are usually x5 to x10 based on wieght


### Inventory

Spaces to write items owned. If an item is worn or carried, it's bulk is listed. Light items are considered .1 Bulk. All bulks are added up and the total is rounded down to determine how much is being carried. Money is tracked seperatly and is not included.

### Trackers

Each tracker has 20 spaces.

#### Supply (Optional)

An abstract method of making sure you have the items you need. Supply items are all rarity 1. 
When you need an item, pay it's price in supply (Every 1 counts as 2L and items are usually 1.5-2x their bulk).
Supply is 1 bulk per 5. Supply is meant to be less efficient.

#### Rations (Optional)

Tracks carried rations. Each basic ration is 1 bulk and includes food/water. Each normal character consumes 1 ration per day.

#### Other (Optional)

10 spaces to track whatever you'd like.

What if combat, like magic had 3 traits that could increased by buying talents.
Attack, Damage, Defense (saves still based on Stress and Will).

If I'm already doing 3 traits for magic and physical, should I also do socail?
    E.g. Clout, Reputation, Status, etc.
Nah.

Traits can augment skills, combat, or magic. Many traits will, in addition to a static bonus (e.g. +1 Attack) grant abilities.
Have skill traits grants skill points, and have each level of a skill cost more (i.e. 1,1,3,3,5) with specialization available at 2 and 4 for (2 and 4 sp each).

Background and culture still grant +1 to skill. 

Experience

Everything should be purchased ala cart. Only talents may be purchased. Training grants XP to be spent towards something.
