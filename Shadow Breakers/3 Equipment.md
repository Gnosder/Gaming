# Chapter 3: Equipment

Equipment are the items and tools that breakers use to get ahead.
Every piece of equipment has a value denoting its quality and bonus. For example a +1 Crowbar is just a simple everyday item. a +2 crowbar is well made and above average quality.

| Quality         | Bonus | Example                                                                      |
| --------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard        | +1    | An item you purchase from a general store.                                   |
| Masterwork      | +2    | An item you have custum made for you by a specialist.                        |
| Enhanced        | +3    | An item with a basic enchantment, special materials, or advanced technology. |
| Advanced Magic  | +4    | An enhanced item with a powerful magical enchantment.                        |
| Legendary Magic | +5    | An enhanced item with a Legendary magical enchantment.                       |
* Note that advanced technology normally caps out at enhanced, but any sufficently advanced technology can be considered magic.

## Armor

In addition to quality, armor has a catagory and may have 1 or more properties. The three armor catagories are light, medium, and heavy which determine the base amount of armor stress they offer as well as any skill penalties. Light armor offers 4 stress and has no penalties; examples include leather cloths and gambitsons. Medium armor offers 6 stress and has a -1 to all physical skills; examples include mail and breastplates. Heavy armor offers 8 stress and has a -3 to all physical skills; example include full plate.

Armor can also suffer wounds in place of it's wearer. Armor can take a total amount of severity equal to half it's stress value before being destroyed. Each point of severity reduces the armor's max stress amount by 2.

Some armor has properties that can enhance or augment its abilities. Armor can have no more than half its base stress value in properties.

Quality increases the stress value of an armor by its amount. This increase does NOT effect how many wouds an armor can take.

## Weapons and Tools

The base effect for any tool is the degree of success the user gets over the DC as such tools only have qualities and properties. If a tool is damaged, meaning its stress would be depleted and it takes a wound, it can suffer an amount of severity equal to its bulk before being destroyed, however any damage to the tool negates any quality bonuses it may have (unless the tool is specifically designed to take damage, like a training dummy).

All tools offer bonuses to any action they were built to assist with. At GM discresion a tool being used for some other purpose (like a crowbar being used as a hammer) only offers half it's normal bonus, rounded down. Some tasks cannot be attempted with a tool, even if the tool offers no bonus.

Some tools also confer abilities to the user. For example, a mess kit allows the user to use the Cook a Meal ability during downtime. Some tools can enable the use of certain abilities, a microscope, for example, enables characters to perceive things too small for them to normally see.

There are tools that only last for a set period, like a torch,or have a set number of uses, like a matchbook. In that case the duration and uses are tracked. Some tools are expended on use, regardless of how long they are used for, like a road flare.
