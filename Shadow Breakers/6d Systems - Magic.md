# Systems - Magic

How to use Magic:

1. Determine if you are casting a known rote spell or are improvising the spell.

If you are casting a rote spell:

As a Swift 

2a. Choose targets for the spell, which defense it will target (Defense, Physical, Mental), and determine the intended effect.
3a. Expend Aura equal to its cost, as determined by the rote being cast.
4a. Expend additional mana in steps equal to the spell's level to increase your casting bonus and paradox by 1 per extra step.

As a Standard Action

    *Spells are always succesfully cast, the roll is to determine if it effects the target or not.

5a. Make a spell attack roll targeting the correct defence. The roll is 2d6 plus power plus your implement's tool bonus plus 1 for each X addional mana you spent plus any other bonuses or penalties.
    * Note: If you have the spell's focus, you gain +1 to the check.
6a. If there is any paradox on the spell, compare your roll and the amount of paradox to the Paradox Table and amend the spell's effect with the results.
7a. If the spell attack roll is greater than the targeted defense the spell effects the target. If the spell did damage, the amount of damage it deals is equal to the difference between the target's defense and the attack roll plus any other bonuses or penalties however, many rotes have a maxium amount of damage they can deal. Expending any extra mana removes that limit but increases local instability the the amount of damage dealt over the limit.

If you are casting an improvised spell.

2b. Use the improvised Spell table to build a spell, then choose targets for the spell, which defense it will target (Defense, Physical, Mental), and determine the intended effect.
3b. Expend mana equal to its cost, taking first from your Aura and then from your Spirit, as determined while building the spell, increase the spell's paradox by the amount spent.
4b. Expend additional mana to increase your casting bonus and increasing paradox by 2 for each extra mana spent.

As a Standard Action

    *Spells are always succesfully cast, the roll is to determine if it effects the target or not.

5b. Make a spell attack roll targeting the correct defence. The roll is 2d6 plus the LOWEST of any applicable traditions plus your implement's tool bonus plus 1 for each addional mana you spent plus any other bonuses or penalties.
    * Note: If you DO NOT have the spell's focus, you suffer a -2 penalty to the check.
6b. If there is any paradox on the spell, compare your roll and the amount of paradox to the Paradox Table and amend the spell's effect with the results.
7b. If the spell attack roll is greater than the targeted defense the spell effects the target. If the spell did damage, the amount of damage it deals is equal to the difference between the target's defense and the attack roll plus any other bonuses or penalties.

# Paradox

Using magic recklessly has a chance of disrupted the natural area, disrupting the spell being cast, or worse.

When you cast a spell with paradox, use the spell attack roll to determine the paradox effect and amount of paradox to determine its severity as listed on the table below.

Paradox Table
| Attack roll | Paradox Effect                                                                                          |
| :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|     1-6     | Suffer X stress.                                                                                        |
|    7-12     | The local area gains x instability**.                                               |
|    13-18    | Roll on the wild magic table X times. Then make a new attack roll and use those results on each target. |
|     18+     | Rip a hole in the fabric of reality to a random plane for X hours.                                      |
    * X is always equal to the amount of paradox.
    ** If the spell has a duration the local stability does not decrease while the spell is in effect.

Wild Magic Table (2d6)
| Roll  | Effect                                                                                                              |
| :---: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  2-4  | Enemy Ricochet: Copy the spell onto a second enemy target closest to the first that has not already been targeted*. |
|  5-6  | Glory: Increase the attack roll by 1.                                                                               |
|   7   | Take 1 Stress.                                                                                                      |
|  8-9  | Doom: Reduce the attack roll by 1.                                                                                  |
| 10-12 | Ally Ricochet: Copy the spell onto a second ally target closest to the first that has not already been targeted*.   |
* If there are no legal targets for the copy of a spell it instead targets the nearest living target instead.

Random Plane Table (1d20)

## Paradox Wounds

If you would take a wound from paradox you gain: Paradoxical X, where X is the amount of left over stress after reaching 0.

Paradoxical adds its value as paradox to future spell casts and is ignored for all other purposes. (It does not effect death, other wounds reiecved, etc.) This wound is healed in the same way as all other wounds, however instead of medical treatment its recovery is sped up simply by being in an area with no instability.

# Area Stability

Every location has a stability score (usually 0) which measures how in tune it is with reality. As space is warped and magic is twisted the location begins to become unstable. As instability rises the location begins to desync from reality. Consult the following chart for the effects of stability.

A location is defined by the GM though are typically a single geographical location. Instability can bleed from one location into adjasent locations.

| Instability | Effect                                                                                     |
| :---------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      0      | No effect                                                                                  |
|     1-9     | Regaining spirit in this area deals stress equal to the instability*.                      |
|    10-20    | Any spell cast in this location gains paradox equal to the locations instability - 10.     |
|     20+     | The area becomes unteathered from reality and undergoes metamorphesis or planar overlay$^. |
    * Any wound received from regaining spirit is "Mana Headache 1" and never increases in severity.
    % Effects can become pemenant if the instability remains high for a season or longer.
    ^ Effect Severity Increases the longer the Instability remains.

Instability decreases by 1 each day it does not increase. Then, if the Instability is greater than 10 all the surrounding locations gain 1 instability.
    * Dear GM, This can be a PITA to track but, don't blame me, blame your foolish magic user instead.
