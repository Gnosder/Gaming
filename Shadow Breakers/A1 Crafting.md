- Crafting Introduction

Crafting is fun. This simple fact is undeniable. Being able to make your own gear and magic items has a special charm to it. Thus the ability to do so in a TTRPG setting is important. However, not all players and tables are interested in doing so, thus crafting is presented as an optional system and is broken up into a basic version and an expert version. The basic version can be inserted into any game without issue. The expert version works best when used along with the Mission table optional rules.

## Basic Crafting

Simply put you supply a formula, gold, and spend time. After doing so you complete the item.

## Expert Crafting

Expert crafting expands on basic crafting by adding Materials needed for each recipe as well as a process for designing new recipes.

People tend to like crafting. Being able to make your own items is cool. Gathering resources, however, is not. What if when you found a resource in the wild, you just unlocked it for use. E.g. You find a peacebloom (Healing, Nature, Herb) in the wild and thus you unlock a check for each of those categories. Recipes will be like "Healing Potion: Base, Healing" and once you have both of those things unlocked you can craft them with just gold and time. So this replaces farming reagents with an unlock system that rewards discovery.
