# Camp Tasks

Time during a rest is fluid. There is no need to play out every minute of a rest. Actions and tasks resolve in a way that makes the most sense. In general, if a character is not engaged in a task they can be assumed to be standing watch.

## Stand Watch

Any character can, at any time, choose to stand watch. Only characters that are standing watch can make perception checks to avoid an ambush. If a character is performing another task, they cannot stand watch.

## Perform Maintenance

Spend time repairing and patching equipment, adjusting bags, checking supplies, and other such things. Each instance of this task takes around 5 minutes. Performing maintenance on armor restores its Armor Stress, but can not repair any damage recieved.

## Partake in Vice

The world is full of vices and the Seeping Void encourages mortals to indulge in them. Indulging in a vice allows a character to roll a willpower die. White pips result in regaining willpower, while black pips result in the Void gaining power. A character can only roll the willpower die this way once per day regardless of results.

## Perform Oblation

Every person has rituals and prayers that they take part in to restore their spirit, to feed their soul. When they perform an oblation they can roll a willpower die and regain as many points of spirit as the pips they roll, regardless of color.A character can only roll the willpower die this way once per day regardless of results.

## Use a Camp Ability

This is a catch all for any camp abilities a character may have access to. The time it takes is listed in the ability description.

E.g. Having a mess kit allows a character to cook a meal which grants shielding for an hour.

# Camp Abilities

## Cook a Meal

With a mess kit and a pinch of skill a character can cook a meal for themeslves and their commrads. Cooking uses either the Craft or Art skill. The result determines how much shielding the meal grants, how long it lasts, and any other bonus effects. Characters can only benefit from a meal once every 6 hours.

| Result | Shielding | Bonus        | Duration |
| ------ | --------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 1-6    | 0         | none         | none     |
| 7-10   | 5         | none         | 1 hour   |
| 11-15  | 7         | +1 temp will | 1 hour   |
| 16+    | 9         | +1 temp will | 4 hours  |

## Tend the Wounded

Wounds need to be tended to regularly to reduce how much they impact characters. A character can treat the wounds of other (with reduced effect if they attempt to treat their own wounds) with an academics (medicine) check. The result determines how much severity can be ignored and for how long. Succor reduces pealties from wounds by its value (This increases maximum spirit and reduces wound penalties), but does NOT impact future wound rolls.

| Result | Succor | Duration |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 1-8    | 0      | none     |
| 9-12   | 1      | 1 hour   |
| 13-15  | 2      | 2 hours  |
| 16+    | 3      | 4 hours  |

## Observe the Rights

There are many rights and traditions that can be observed for many different effects. This task typically requires a ritual or special knowledge and counts as an oblation in addition to its other effects. Some can count as a vice as well.

Typical effects of observing the rights is a reduction of instability in an area, a bonus to some types of magic and effects, or the creation or maintenance of a resource.

## Craft an item

Crafting during a short rest is usually a quick and dirty affair. Items made this way typically don't last for very long and have limited durability. (To craft quality items, do so during a long rest).
