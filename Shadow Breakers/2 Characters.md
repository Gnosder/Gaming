# 2. Characters

In Dusk Breakers the characters are all Heroes. They may not want it, they may not be good, but they have something others do not and the Seeping Darkness knows it.

## Character Creation

### Concept

Characters can be built with a template or ala cart, but regardless of the method chosen having an idea of who the character is will be vital.

### Background

Every hero starts out their life as something else -- like a baker, a farmer, a soldier, or an assassin -- before coming into their own. A character's backgroun reflects this. It's about who they were and what they did before they became a hero.

Typically grants 2 skills +1

### Ancestry and Culture

Before becoming a hero every character must be born. This will impart certain charateristics, values, and taboos to the character. Where they born a Dwarf in a Dwarven stronghold? Or perhaps as an Elf in a human metropolis? Ancestry determines certain features and traits and Culture determines the values the character holds.

Typically grants 1-2 skills +1, as well as free merits and flaws (Most cultures will have a Taboo which is a flaw). Characters do not gain extra merit points for ancestral or cultural flaws.


### Skills

There are 21 skills (26 for mages) broken up into 3(4) catagories, Physical, Social, and Knowledge, (and Techniques). Each starting character starts with 21 skill points that can be spent as they choose. However, no skill can be higher than 3 at the start.

A skill point can be speant to purchasea specialization in a skill. This is a narrow subset of the skill, but grants an extra +2 when it applies. No more than 3 specializations can be purchased at the start and each skill can have only 1.

Lore is a special skill, it serves as a catch-all for more esoteric or specific knowledge that is not covered by the other skills. Lore can be taken multiple times and each time a new knowledge group is chosen. The most common Lores are related to the game itself. Perhaps its lore of a Local area or kingdom, or of the Heraldry of known civilizations, or perhaps a lost culture.

Not all skills are created equal, some are used for more than they seem. Athletics, for example, is used to determine max carry weight and to make recovery rolls in addition to its other uses. For mages, the knowledge skill used by their tradtion (Arcane, Nature, Occult, Religion, etc) determines the max level of their techniques. Knowledge is power.

### Merits

Each character has 7 points that can be speant to purchase merits. A character can also take flaws to gain more points. The first flaw grants 2 extra points and each flaw after that grants 1.

Merits cover many different things granting bonuses, abilities, or resources. At character creation any merit may be purchased with points, however after character creation some can only be purchased with experience while others can only be earned through play.

Some merits can only be purchased during character creation, however this is not a rigid rule, if you have a good reason for picking one later the GM is encouraged to agree. In most games, characters will be granted 1 point of the Heroism merit for free.

### Staus tracks

There are 4 main status tracks Stress, Willpower, Spirit, and Victories.

Stress determines a character's physical and mental wellbeing. As it diminishes the character becomes wounded and can die. Current stress is also applied as a bonus to any Physical Saves. Stress recovers by taking short breaks and earning victories, see *resting*.

Willpower (WP) tracks the reserve of inner strength of each character. While it is not attacked directly, it can be spent to apply bonuses to actions with each WP speant granting +2. It can also be used reflexivly when stress reaches zero to restore half of max stress (rounded up) for 1 point. Willpower recovers by taking long rests and indulging in vices, see *resting*.

Spirit (SP) tracks how much mana the character has stored in their soul. This can be used to power abilities and reflexivly to also restore stress when it reaches 0. Spirit reocvers over time and through oblations, see *resting*.

Finally, Victories track a character's Triumphs. Each victory serves to enbolden a character, driving them to even greater heights. Victories reset during a long rest and are converted into experience.

### Abilities and Magic

Magic is everywhere and in everything and even those who do not walk the path of the Magi can still use it and be effected by it. WHile most characters will have abilities that use SP, which are magic, only the ones who choose to become Magi (by purchasing the required merit) can shape magic to their wills.

Magi gain a few things that others do not have. First they gain 5 extra skills (called techniques) that they can spend points on. Second, they gain an additional mana track, called Aura, which tracks how much of the ambient magic they have absorbed into themselves. Third, they gain a tradition, focus, and bane which describe how they learn magic, what their magic specializes in, and what magics or acts are anathma to them. Finally, A magi can learn spells (Often reffered to as Rote spells) which they are trained in and can use at will. Magi can also cast spells they haven't learned, though doing so can be dangerous.

## Ancestries and Cultures

A character's Ancestry (sometimes called race or species) is more about their physical characteristics while their culture is about when and where they grew up and their learned characteristics. Anestries are often off a discrete list (What are the races that exist in the world). Cultures, however, are much more nebulous and there aren't any set in stone. They are more about time, place, and context. (Its ok to use a real world cultural base or to even make up your own, everyone is different).

## Merits

// 
Merits are huge, there are many of them, but they should come in only a few different packages; Enablers, Passives, Abilities, and Resources. 
"Classes" should exist only as a collection of differnt merits.
Merits should be regional/cultural if they are learned.
Each dot in a merit costs 1 point. Some merits may require more than 1 dot.

### Legendary Merits

A legendary merit is one that only the GM (before play) or a powerful divinity (during play) can grant you. After being granted the merit, additional levels can be purchased as normal, but may be subject to restrictions and or requiments.

#### Heroism

Type: Multiple

Requirement: Granted by GM at character creation or by divinity in play.

You have been chosen. You are a Hero. A Shadow Breaker. This makes you better than other people, stronger, faster, more reslient, but it also imposes a heavy burden. You will forever be targeted by the Seeping Doom and hunted for all your days, because you have been given the power to fight it.

The first point in Heroism grants a number of passive effects. It costs you only 1 point of WP to activate it's effects instead of 2. You may spend WP to recover stress when your spirit is depleated. Wounds you receive heal 5 times faster than normal. All experience costs are reduced by 1 to a minimum of 1. All training times are 10 times faster than normal. People can tell, intuitivly, that you are not an ordinary person.

You may only purchase the second point after spending at least 10 experience points first.
The second point in Heroism grants you +2 to all social checks and people you meet know, instictivly, that you are a hero.

Note: The rules in this book are written assuming you have at least one point in this merit and so all the bonuses are reflected by default. Not taking this merit allows for people to play non-heroes.

Note: Each point in this after the first requires a certain amount of experience to have already be spent.

#### Imortallity

### Physical Merits

A physical merit is tied to a character's body. They may be larger than normal, have a higher pain tolerance, or a better memory. These merits cannot be "learned" though they can be revealed through play. (If you wish to take one of these merits after character creation, you must get GM approval; "magic did it" can be a meaningful reason).

#### Sample Merits
Giant
Dwarf
Iron Stomach
Natural Immunity
Quick Draw
Quick Healer
Strong Back
Strong Lungs
Toxin Resistance
Diehard
Striking Looks

### Skill Merits

These merits are about learning and improving skills and trades. Almost all of these merits apply only to a single skill, task, or (more rarely) a group of tasks and so they can be taken multiple times

#### Sample Merits
Language
Profesional
Skilled Learner

### Martial Merits

These merits are about fighting and physical prowess. Many of these merits apply to discreate martial traditions or reginons (for example you won't find "Fighting Style: Boxing" but instead might find "Fighting Style: East Berin Boxing").

#### Sample Merits
Danger Sense
Fighting Style

### Magical Merits

These Merits are about using and controlling magic. Usually in order to take these merits a character must first learn one of the many magical traditions.

#### Sample Merits
Zratchan Necromancy

### Social Merits

These merits are about ones status and standing in society. These merits are usually (but not always) context dependent and might require the character to specify where or with whom it applies (Being the king of Berin doesn't mean much if you're surrounded by zombies after all). Most social merits can only be purchased during character creation and must be earned through play.

#### Sample Merits
Allies
Barfly
Contacts
Fame
Inspiring
Mentor
Resources
Retainer
Status
