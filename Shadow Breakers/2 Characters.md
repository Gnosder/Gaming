# 2. Characters

Dusk Breakers are Heroes, they may not want it, they may not be good, but they have something others do not and the Seeping Void knows it.

## Character Creation

### Concept

All characters start with an idea, a concept and are built from there.

### Background

Every hero starts out their life as something else -- like a baker, a farmer, a soldier, or an assassin -- before coming into their own. A character's background reflects this. It's about who they were and what they did before they became a hero.

Typically grants +1 to 2 skills.

### Ancestry and Culture

Before becoming a hero every character must be born. This will impart certain charateristics, values, and taboos to the character. Where they born a Dwarf in a Dwarven stronghold? Or perhaps as an Elf in a human metropolis? Ancestry determines certain features and traits and Culture determines the values the character holds.

Culture typically grants +1 to 2 skills and might include a taboo, religion, or virtue.
Ancestry is more about physical characteristics such as having a tail or claws. Bonuses and penalties are many and varied.

### Common Cultures
Elven Glades like Tir na Nog
Dwarven Clans like the Stonebeard Clan
Orcish Steppe Clans like Clan Natoshk
Orcish Mountain Holds like the Burning Rock Clan
Saurian Empires (mostly in decline) like Zlatlan
Beastkin Tribes like the petalfoot
Human Settlements and city states (Coastal and thasilocratic) like Theramor

### Common Ancestries
Elven - Ancient immigrants from the Feywild
Dwarven - Once children of the shapers infected by the curse of flesh.
Human - A race of refugees from a world consumed by the seeping void.
Orc- Native creatures of the world.
Beastkin - Natural creatures of the world changed and uplifted by fey magics. Often mammillion.
Saurian - Native creatures of the world. Evolved from reptiles and seperate from beastkin.

### Skills

There are 20 skills broken up into 3 catagories, Physical, Social, and Knowledge. Each starting character starts with 21 skill points that can be spent with an additional 4 granted by background and culture. However, no skill can be higher than 3 at the start. When spending skill points at character creation, at least 5 must be spent in each of the 3 catagories.

A skill point can be speant to purchase a specialization in a skill once the skill has reached rank 4. This is a narrow subset of the skill, but grants an advantage when used.

Lore is a special skill, it serves as a catch-all for more esoteric or specific knowledge that is not covered by the other skills. Lore can be taken multiple times and each time a new knowledge group is chosen. The most common Lores are related to the game itself. Perhaps its lore of a Local area or kingdom, or of the Heraldry of known civilizations, or perhaps a lost culture. All Lore skills are treated as a specialization and thus grant advantage.

Not all skills are created equal, some are used for more than they seem. Athletics, for example, is used to determine max carry weight and to make recovery rolls in addition to its other uses.

### Advances

As characters gain experience they get advances. Think of these as mini level ups. When a character gains an advantage they may choose any unchosen advantage on the list. Once each advantage has been chosen, the list is reset and the character's tier increases by 1. Characters must choose Class as their first advance. A character gains an advance every 3 experience gained.

List of Advances
- Class
- Skill
- Feature
- Ability
- Characteristic
- Free

#### Class

One of the most impactful advances. A class determines the role, focus, and direction of a character. Every character is considered Tier 0 until they have chosen a class. Only classes can grant access to Aura.

#### Skill

Choosing skill grants an ability or feature that impacts the use of a skill as well as 4 extra skill points. Skill features typically reduce time to use a skill (e.g. cutting crafting time in half) or allow skills to be used in different ways (e.g. can use deception to detect lies rather than empathy).

#### Feature

A feature is a passive trait that improves or enhances a character. 

#### Ability

An ability is often an active action that costs resources (spirt being most common).

#### Characteristic

When this advance is chosen characters gain +2 to 2 of their 3 status tracks (Stress, Willpower, Spirit).

#### Free

This advance allows any of the other advances to be taken again except for class.


### Staus tracks

There are 4 main status tracks Stress, Willpower, and Spirit. A character starts with 8 stress, 6 sprit, and 4 willpower.

Stress determines a character's physical and mental well being. As it diminishes the character becomes wounded and can die. Stress recovers by taking short breaks and earning victories, see *resting*.

Willpower (WP) tracks the reserve of inner strength of each character. While it is not attacked directly, it can be spent to apply bonuses to actions with each WP speant granting +2. It can also be used reflexivly when stress reaches zero to restore half of max stress (rounded up) for 1 point. Willpower recovers by taking long rests and indulging in vices, see *resting*.

Spirit (SP) tracks how much mana the character has stored in their soul. This can be used to power abilities and reflexivly to also fully restore stress when it reaches 0 by expending 1 point. Spirit reocvers over time and through oblations, see *resting*.

### Defenses

A character has several ways to avoid damage. In social situations, they will typically oppose actions with a skill. In combat, characters rely on their defense (which is their athletics skill + 5), their Physical resistance (which is their stress minus any wounds), and their Mental resistance (which is their max spirit minus any wounds)

## Advances by Name

#### Heroism / Breaker

Type: Special

Requirement: Granted by GM at character creation or by divinity in play.

You have been chosen. You are a Hero. A Shadow Breaker. This makes you better than other people, stronger, faster, more reslient, but it also imposes a heavy burden. You will forever be targeted by the Seeping Doom and hunted for all your days, because you have been given the power to fight it.

The first point in Heroism grants a number of passive effects. It costs you only 1 point of WP to activate it's effects instead of 2. You may spend WP to recover stress when your spirit is depleated. Wounds you receive heal 5 times faster than normal. All experience gains are doubled. All training times are 10 times faster than normal. People can tell, intuitivly, that you are not an ordinary person.

There is a penalty, however. As you gain victories you become easier to notice by the Seeping Void. At each victory tier (2,4,7) the void can enhance future challenges.

Future ranks require certain prerequisites to be met.

Note: The rules in this book are written assuming you have this feature and so all the bonuses are reflected by default. Not taking this merit allows for people to play non-heroes. If you are not a breaker, it takes 6 experience to gain an advance, Willpower is harder to use and can't refill stress, wounds heal slower and it takes longer to train.
