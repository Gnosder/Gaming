# Combat

Combat is swift and fluid. 

    Deference to the defender. 
    Deference to the fastest.

## Steps

1. Determine Initiative and turn order

    * Fastest is higher in the order.

2. Resolve Swift Actions from slowest to fastest.

3. Resolve Standard Actions from fastest to slowest.

    * This could be incrementing counters, determing action debts, etc.

## Action Debt

There are times it is needed to take an abort action after having already taken a Standard action. In this instance the abort action can be taken, but only a swift action can be taken on the next turn. If another abort action is taken this restriction continues until neither a standard nor an abort action is taken.

## Actions out of Order

It is possible to take a swift action in place of a standard action, in this case you may take a second swift action.

# Action List

## Aid

Swift Action

Take this action to attempt to assist an ally's Standard Action. Must declare HOW you are assisting and what action you are assisting. If the target takes a different action this bonus is lost.

Make a skill check that is one tier easier than what the target will take. Grant the target +2/+1/0/-1 to the action.

## Aim

Swift Action

Declare your target and attack. Then gain +2 Aim bonus to your standard action so long as you attack that target and in the declared way.

## Attack

Standard Action

Make an attack against a target within range of your held weapon. Make an attack roll by rolling 2d6 and add your Fighting skill, your weapon's tool bonus and any other bonuses or penalties. If you roll higher than your target's defense you deal damage to them equal to the difference between your roll and their defense.

## Attacks of Oportunity

Free Action

Any standard action except for attacking with a melee weapon provokes attacks of oportunity. All AoO are made with a cumlative -2 penalty. Fighting 2 or higher is required to make an AoO.

## Brace

Abort Action, Interupt

Stay in place and ready your defenses to absorb an attack. Reduce stress taken by the attack by 1.

## Cast

Swift and Standard Action

As a swift action declare the spell being used and its targets, pay any costs associated with the casting, then as a standard action complete the spell casting and determine its effect.

If the standard action is not taken the spell fails.

If you take damage while casting a spell you might have to make a concentration check.

## Defend

Swift Action

EITHER gain +1 defense or choose a target within 5ft, for the rest of the round attacks that you can intercept* hit you if the attack is greater than the target's defense and hit the target if the attack is greater than your defense.

*You can intercept attacks only if the attacker is within arms reach of you or the ranged attack would pass 'through' you.

## Dodge

Abort Action, Interrupt

Dive 5ft in any direction and fall prone. This can cause actions to miss. You can dive over any object or terrain that you can easily jump over (without a check) or clamber up onto a nearby ledge.

If you dodge behind an object that grants you cover you can increase cover bonuses by 1 until the end of the round and gain full cover.

## Double Move

Standard Action

Move up to double your speed. If you move at least 15ft, running jumpds receive a +2 bonus and you gain +1 to your defense.

## Fallback

Abort Action, Interrupt

Move your speed and ignore the first AoO you provoke.

## Find Item

Swift Action

Attempt to find an item in your pack or a nearby area. This uses a flat roll (2d6) vs a static difficulty of 6/9. On pass, the item is found. On fail, can continue as standard action and gain advantage on the roll.

## Hold

Swift Action

By taking this action you skip your Swift Action and jump to the top of the initiative list for determining when you can take your standard action. (Note you only move to the top of the list, it is possible for someone who acts after you to declare a hold and jump above you.)

## Interact

Swift Action

You use your hand or hands to manipulate an object or the terrain. You can grab an unattended or stored object, draw a weapon, swap a held item for another, open a door, or achieve a similar effect. On rare occasions, you might have to attempt a skill check to determine if your Interact action was successful.

## Move

Swift Action

Can move up to your speed.

## Ready Action

Swift Action

When using this action you declare a standard action and a trigger for it, you may take that action as soon as the trigger happens. If the trigger does not happen, you may take a standard action at the end of the round. This action can interrupt.

## Resist

Standard Action or Abort Action, Interupt

You attempt to resist against anything that binds you, be it physical or magic. If taken as a Standard action, gain +2.

## Scan

Swift Action

Briefly scan the area. This can reveal terrain actions and combatants that were not immedeatly noticed (Anything with a DC). Can instead target an individual and allows details to be noticed (Anything with a DC). Can instead ask a single, probing question about the area or an individual or object you can see, such questions should be simple eliciting a yes/no or, at most, a brief answer.

## Seek

Standard Action

A better version of the Scan action. Does everything scan does but confers a +2 bonus to any checks or allows 2 questions to be asked. Can reveal if there is a hidden creature or object in the area on a DC 9 perception.

## Snap Shot

Abort Action, Interrupt

Take a hurried shot against a target. You lose any aiming bonuses and take -2 to the roll.

## Use Item

Standard Action

If you have an item in your hand or on your immediate person, you may use it. This applies mostly to items that were not readied for use.

## Use Ready Item

Swift Action

If you have items readied for quick use (via a bandolier or have them placed in a quick administraion vial, etc.) you can use them as a swift action.

## Withdraw

Standard Action

You may move your speed without provoking any AoO.

# Conditions

## Cover

Cover is rated by its strength and the amount you are behind it (e.g. whether you are fully behind it, or partially behind it while shooting). The stronger the cover the greater the defense bonus will be and how you are positioned behind that cover determines if an attack can hit you.

Cover is rated from 1-4, granting that much bonus defense.

If you are partially behind cover an attack can only hit you if it rolls above your defense AND the dice rolled an even number OR if the attack can pierce the cover.

If you are fully behind cover an attack can only hit you if it rolls above your defense AND the  attack can pierce the cover.

Using the Dodge action to jump behind cover you increase the cover's rating by 1 until the end of the round and gain full cover.

As a part of any move action you move behind cover. You receive its defense bonus and determine whether you have full or partial cover. 

## Prone

While prone you may not move further than 5ft per movement. You get a +2 cover bonus against ranged attacks, but a -2 penalty against melee attacks. If you take an action that allows you to move you may expend 5ft of that movement to stand up.
