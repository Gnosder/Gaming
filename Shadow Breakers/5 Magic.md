# Magic

There are multiple sources of Magic, though all of it is Aether.

Power Source (determines where the aehter comes from / what form it is in)
Arcane, Divine

Arcane is the default. Arcane mages draw aether from the world around them and shape it in ocordance with their tradition.

Divine is also known as gift magic. While aether from the world can be used the spells are typically shaped and payed for by a third party and given to the user.

Traditons (determine how magic is utilized (what spells look like, etc))
- Mysticism, witchcraft, blood magic, rune magic, Singing, Dancing, Hermetic, Druidic, Shamanism, Astrology, Black Magic

Casting a spell takes the following:

A desire (what the spell needs to do)

An image (what the spell will do)

Aether (to pay for the spell)

Casting (to combine the aether and image into a spell)

First you decide what you need to do (Declare actions; e.g. "I want to blow them up with fire"), second you build the image in your mind (what the spell will do)

All magic has Techniques:
- Create
- Perceive
- Transform
- Destroy
- Control

And all magic has forms determined by tradition:
    Attempting a form not given to you by your tradition invokes a penalty.

What if spirit is 1-10, but aura is uncapped (like sorcery points in dnd, but based more on a warlock).
As you gain in power (i.e. picking up magical talents) your aura increases.
Magic has 3 attributes: Force [power], Aura [storage], Memory [spell list size], these increase by taking talents. (This replaces techniques).

Talent to covert spirit to aura, each tier increases conversion rate.

Building spells: Choose an effect to determine spell level, then choose modifiers to determine complexity. Level determmines base aura cost which is then modified by complexity.








Magic is as intrinsic to the world as gravity. Everyone has seen it and knows of it, most people can use it in some capacity, but there are few who can fully control it.

Magic is best written and understood using the Umbra Cypher, a language of unknown origin. Any other language used suffers a -1 penalty.

Magic or Aether is created by life. The more life forms an area has or the more biodiverse an area is the more Aether the area has. Aether is somewhat impacted by gravity. As it is created it spreads out becoming thinner at higher elevations and thicker at lower. Once a world is fully saturated it begins to sink into the world where it forms into a 'life stream' or 'Aetheric Consciousness'. The concentration of Aether is virtually identical at any point on the surface (so long as the user is within the atmosphere).

Aether, while it is created by life is also attracted to it. Aether pools in life froms and, as their own life force works on it, congeals into a 'Soul'. Most creatures will have a fully formed soul at some point in early adolesence. The soul is both a copy of a creature's personality and will as well as an Aetheric battery.

For most creatures they can draw on the Aether within their soul to enhance their body. Most creatures cannot draw from or use ambient aether, it must be mediated or processed in some way first.

Creatures instinctivly release or 'tithe' a portion of their Aether during any sort of prayer, oblation, or exaltation to the object of their behavior. E.g. whilst praying to a God a creature tithes a portion of their Aether to that God; e.g. while attending a performance of a popular Bard the adoring crowd tithes some of their Aether to that performer. Most creatures do not know or notice they do this. Intense emotions or extreme situations can also cause this to happen, but the Aether is released into the world insted of tithed to another. When a mortal creature is tithed Aether it is often just bled out into the world unless that creature can catch and manipulate it.

For most beings Aether is a passive force that exists in the world as a natural part of existance. It can allow people to do 'super human' feats, but it is rarly thought of in such a way. These things are normal and typically grow with age. E.g. an Eldery laborer might be able to easily lift several hundred pounds of stone by themself; e.g. a veteran soldier might be able to march for days without rest. While all creatures eventually sucumb to time and pass on, age typically confers strength until very near the end. The presence of Aether increases mortal lifespans greatly.
