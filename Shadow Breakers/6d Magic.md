# Magic

See chapter 5 for full rules.

Magic comes works in 3 main ways:

- Spell Casting
- Improvised Casting
- Rituals

## Spell Casting

A charater can cast any spell they know by taking the appropriate actions and paying the spell's cost. Many character capable of casting spells can also augment their spells to increase their power, but at the risk of gaining paradox.

## Improvised Casting

Sometimes a character wishes to cast a spell they do not know (i.e. they wish to improvise the spell). This is possible, but much riskier than normal magic. Improvising a spell accumulates paradox much faster than normal which can result in unintended effects. Improvised spells can also wound or even kill a character.

## Rituals

A ritual is a measured and practice casting of a spell. They allow of characters to cast magic beyond their abilities without the normal risks of dooing so thus rituals are much safer than casting spells, but also much slower. Any spell that can be cast can be performed as a ritual. Rituals do not suffer paradox and do not require the character to expend any of their own aura or spirit, however they do have costs in terms of time and materials -- some of which can be incredibly rare and expensive.

To perform a ritual a character must first prepare the site. This usually means the drawing of magical symbols, like a circle or pentacle, and the placement of materials and foci. Then a character must cast the ritual. A character can only cast a ritual they know and some may require more than 1 person to take part in it, these individuals are known as participants while the caster is known as the ritual master.

On completion of a ritual the Ritual Master makes a spell check to determine the spell's effect.
