# Paradox

Using magic recklessly has a chance of disrupted the natural area, disrupting the spell being cast, or worse.

When you cast a spell with paradox, use the spell attack roll to determine the paradox effect and amount of paradox to determine its severity as listed on the table below.

Paradox Table
| Attack roll | Paradox Effect                                                                                          |
| :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|     1-6     | Suffer X stress.                                                                                        |
|    7-12     | The local area gains x instability**.                                               |
|    13-18    | Roll on the wild magic table X times. Then modify the attack roll and use those results on each target. |
|     18+     | Rip a hole in the fabric of reality to a random plane for X hours.***                                   |
    * X is always equal to the amount of paradox.
    ** If the spell has a duration the local stability does not decrease while the spell is in effect.
    *** Only if the area is already Instable. Otherwise reduce X by 1 and treat it as a roll on the wild magic table.

|  2-4  | Enemy Ricochet: Copy the spell onto a second enemy target closest to the first that has not already been targeted*. |
|  5-6  | Glory: Increase the attack roll by 1.                                                                               |

|  8-9  | Doom: Reduce the attack roll by 1.                                                                                  |
| 10-12 | Ally Ricochet: Copy the spell onto a second ally target closest to the first that has not already been targeted*.   |
* If there are no legal targets for the copy of a spell it instead targets the nearest living target instead.

## Paradox Wounds

If you would take a wound from paradox you gain: Paradoxical X, where X is the amount of left over stress after reaching 0.

Paradoxical adds its value as paradox to future spell casts and is ignored for all other purposes. (It does not effect death, other wounds reiecved, etc.) This wound is healed in the same way as all other wounds, however instead of medical treatment its recovery is sped up simply by being in an area with no instability.

# Area Stability

Every location has a stability score (usually 0) which measures how in tune it is with reality. As space is warped and magic is twisted the location begins to become unstable. As instability rises the location begins to desync from reality. Consult the following chart for the effects of stability.

A location is defined by the GM though are typically a single geographical location. Instability can bleed from one location into adjasent locations.

| Instability | Effect                                                                                     |
| :---------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      0      | No effect                                                                                  |
|     1-9     | Regaining spirit in this area deals stress equal to the instability*.                      |
|    10-20    | Any spell cast in this location gains paradox equal to the locations instability - 10.     |
|     20+     | The area becomes unteathered from reality and undergoes metamorphesis or planar overlay$^. |
    * Any wound received from regaining spirit is "Mana Headache 1" and never increases in severity.
    $ Effects can become pemenant if the instability remains high for a season or longer.
    ^ Effect Severity Increases the longer the Instability remains.

Instability decreases by 1 each day it does not increase. Then, if the Instability is greater than 10 all the surrounding locations gain 1 instability.
    * Dear GM, This can be a PITA to track but, don't blame me, blame your foolish magic user instead.
