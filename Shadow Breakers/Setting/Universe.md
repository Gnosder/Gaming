# Universe

The setting is an entire multi-verse. The SHELL is structed like an egg. At the top of the SHELL is the Heavens and the Grace, at the bottom is the Confux and the Source, in the center is a Torus ring that holds the pysical universe and within its center is the planar holds. The Ocean is what surrounds all, it is the space within the SHELL; this is the Divine Paradigm or Voice of Reality. THe Ocean currents flow from Source to Grace, though they take may pathways. Smaller Rivers (more like nested oceans) flow out of the Univeral Torus and merge into the Ocean.

Outside the SHELL is the VOID it is an anti-real paradigm. Reality breaks down into something new. The things that exist in the VOID are OUTSIDERS; while their true motives are unknown and unknowable they clearly see the SHELL as something to be destroyed (A pathogen within a larger host). OUtsiders have made their way into the SHELL before and exist on islands in the ocean that are neither Plane nor reality.

On nameing and capitalisation: Words only have meaning within their paradigm. Some concepts are required to be known by the auther, but cannot be named outside of a cultural context. Names in all capitals are these conceptual names and will oft be translated or misinterpreted. Words in title case are generally agreed upon though they too can be translated or misinterpreted.

SHELL - THe entierety of knowable existance. THe shell contains the real universe as well as the meta-physical plans. Outside this shell all understanding and reason breaks down.
OCEAN - the vast near-infinite space within the SHELL.
VOID - An unknowable expanse that includes all potential space outside the shell. This space exists outside the universal paradigm.
UNIVERSAL PARADIGM - The set of rules, ideas, and laws that govern the reality within the SHELL. Often known as Physics, Magics, Divines.
OUTSIDERS - Entities and things that exist outside the SHELL and therefore are ungoverned by the UNIVERSAL PARADIGM.
HEAVENS: A place where the DIVINES rule and shape reality at the top of the SHELL; Planar holds of the Gods and the location of their afterlives. The realms of Meta-Order
GRACE - A singularity where all reality goes to die. It is an end but also gives many beginnings. Much of the UNIVERSAL ENERGY destroyed here flows around the inner edges of the SHELL back to the SOURCE.
CONFLUX - A chaotic and everchanging universe that orders the UNIVERSAL ENERGY into useuable forms known to the UNIVERSAL PARADIGM. The meta-relams of Chaos.
SOURCE - A singularity at the nadir of the egg. Consumes the formless and inert UNIVERSAL ENERGY given by the GRACE and empowers it to be reshaped in the CONFLUX.
UNIVERSAL ENERGY - Energy-Matter that makes up the UNIVERSAL PARADIGM. It is created in the SOURCE, forged in the CONFLUX, Distributed in the HEAVENS, and destroyed in the GRACE after which is cycles aback around to the SOURCE to begin again.
UNIVERSAL TORUS - The conflicting of Choas and Order caused a universe to be born in the center of the SHELL. This universe holds all of Physical Reality (The Material Planes). This space is mostly controled by the PHYSICS, but the MAGICS and DIVINES both hold some sway.
PLANAR HOLDS - The UNIVERSAL TORUS was unstable at its center (while it was a sphere) and spread apart to create an energy rich conduit in the OCEAN that UNIVERSAL ENERGY travels from SOURCE to GRACE. Within this space relams came into being that were more connected the the MAGICS and DIVINES than the PHYSICS.
PHYSICS - The first of the UNIVERSAL TRINITY (aka UNIVERSAL PARADIGM). This is the laws of physics or how the clock spings.
MAGICS - The second of the UNIVERSAL TRINITY. This is the laws of magic or how the clock has meaning.
DIVINES - The third of the UNIVERSAL TRINITY. This is the laws of Gods and Order or why the clock exists at all and its purpose.
