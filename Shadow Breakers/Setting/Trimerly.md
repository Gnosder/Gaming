# Trimerly (Paupa Mardang)

A small town near the cultural hub of Goroka (A major trade hub and cultural mixing pot) in the larger territory of Paupa Mardang. Despite the gradually colonising nature of the region Trimerly has managed to keep its culture and integrate with the influx of western ideas. Its language of Tok Pisin is a pidign mix of the local languages that rose a generation ago with the first 'tourists' (western traders). It's traditional racal mix is Lizardfolk/Sauren and Wildkin/Furbolgs, but it has become fairly cosmopolitan. The locals welcome all with open arms and an open mind, though they have little patience for those who are similarly open.

## History

    A tribal society that was recently exposed to western ideals (European and Indian) and happily integrated. Before the coming of the "Tourists" the small penensula nation of Paupa Mardang willing unified as both the Mossy Saurens and the Firgolgs are peacful anamists. While the Red Saurens are bitter they have retreated to the central vale of Panguna. When the Tourists first arrived (a simple expedition that was welcoming and welcomed) a flourishing trade route opened as a way to connect the continent of Dul Kazak Itmar to the western continents of Jirad and Imbala. Many Tourists decided to settle in the peacful and fertal regions of Paupa Mardang and have integrated with the locals. Most Tourists have setteled in and near the capital city of Goroka.

## Government

  The local government is a multi-branched Gerentocracy. The first branch is the Council of Elders, a body made up of all Elder members (of any race) so long as they were borne in the region or they were accepted by the spirits in a Turning Ritual. The council handles domestic issues.

  The second branch is the theocratic Clutch of Virman, a druidic sect that is a mix of Sauren Animalism and Firbolg Shamanism. The leaders of the clutch are the 5 Druids most respected by the local nature. They keep the local spirits appeased.

  The final branch is the Akali Paragon, a reincarnated spiritual leader said to be a scion of the dual faced god Akali (War and Peace). The paragon is respected and has a voice, but not a vote in the Council of Elders (as they are seen as the Eldest of all) and they deal mostly with external diplomacy .

## Religion

Prior to the arival of the Tourists there were 3 large cultural groups each with their own religions. The peacful Mossy Saurens worshiped nature and the peacful face of Akali. The xenophobic Red Saurens worshiped the Bloody face of Akali and their war-saints the Endless Sisters. Finally the Firbolgs, arrived from the Fae lands, Worship nature and offer tribute to the Summer Queen.

Akali is a dual faced God who is genderless and who is tied to the two seasons of the region (summer and wet). The first of the god's faces, known as Akali-Nou, is peacful and benevelant; they want people to flouish and accepts all regardless of any differences; their aspects are Peace, Healing, Life, Light, and Nature. Akali's second face, known as Akali-Mou, is belicose and insular; they demand that all prove themselves before nature and that only the strong are fit to exist; their aspects are War, Nature, Storm, Death, and Order.

## Magic

Druidic and Divine magic are well known in the region. Those who can use either are accepted into the Cluch of Virman and barred from the Council of Elders. Respect for and by the natural world is heavily favored. Those who fall out of favor with nature or Akali are cast out of society.

Arcane magic is rather new to the area having arrived with the Tourists, but it is accepted so long as it respects nature.

## Technology

The region is a pre-metal society, but they harden the scales of dead saurens to create armor on par with steel. They lack many of the technological advances of the Tourists, but they have eagerly embraced all of their "Luggage", though they have not been willing to industrialize.

## Education

Children are taught and raised by Village Elders in large groups, or Creches. They learn about nature, about the balance of nature, and that all beings are united siblings beneath Akali-Ka. Recently they have begun to teach western academics as well and this knowledge is seen as useful and desierable among the native peoples.

## Species

The region has two main species. The native Saurens (Lizardfolk) have to distinct sub-branches the Mossy and the Red; where one is peacful and druidic while the second is warlike and barbarous.

The Firbolgs migrated to the region from the deep forest hills of Arkadia by way of the fey low-way.

Recently the western races as well as the Dark Forged Dwarves have come to the region.

## Language

The primary language of the region is called Tok Pisis and is a pidgin hybrid of both Sauren and the Firbolg language of An Focal.

## Sex and Gender

Sex is hard to determine among Saurens and gender is expressed freely. Firbolgs have a more 'traditional' sex and gender dicotomy, but are open to others.

## Organizations

The Council of Elders

The Clutch of Virman

The Paragal Ascendent (The organization of the Paragon of Akali)

Spire of Mou: Red Sauren war hierarchy
