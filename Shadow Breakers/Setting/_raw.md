Lore:

In the beginning was Ka, All things, but even they could not contain the vastness of reality within themselves. They exploded greatly (big bang).

As ka swirled in the early universe, it began to settle into the greater shapes (Light, Dark, Order, Chaos).

From the shapes were born the ka-Gods:
    Tagi-ka -- Order
    Alobil-ka -- Neutral
    Zuli-ka -- Chaos
    Kili-ka -- Dark
    Shera-ka -- Light

Then came the incarnates:
    Rilitta -- water
    Amanit -- wind
    Zitum -- Earth
    Urzi -- Fire
    Tava -- Arcane

Finally were born the Shapers:
    Triti -- Fate/time
    Diorix -- Angels
    Allucius -- Fae
    Adnamu -- Mortals
    Ricua -- Time
    Carosia -- Elementals
    Eliomara -- Trickery
    Licnos -- Darkness

As the shapers went to work, they drew the attention of the void lord Cthothoxr (Cth-otho-sher). The ka-gods went to war with the void and banished Cthothoxer outside their reality. Zuli-ka was killed in the conflict and Tagi-ka, fearing an imbalance, killed themself. Zuli-ka's body collapsed into the abyssal syst that spawns demons, while Tagi-ka's will formed the Ordo, a barrier around reality that keeps the void lords out.

After the war the shapers resumed their work and built the canopany of Ka.
