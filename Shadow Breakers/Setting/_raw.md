Dusk breakers chosen by light to combat seeping darkness (a void God invading reality)

Lore:

In the beginning was Ka, All things, but even they could not contain the vastness of reality within themselves. They exploded greatly (big bang).

As ka swirled in the early universe, it began to settle into the greater shapes (Light, Dark, Order, Chaos).

From the shapes were born the ka-Gods:
    Tagi-ka -- Order
    Alobil-ka -- Neutral
    Zuli-ka -- Chaos
    Kili-ka -- Dark
    Shera-ka -- Light

Then came the incarnates:
    Rilitta -- water
    Amanit -- wind
    Zitum -- Earth
    Urzi -- Fire
    Tava -- Arcane

Finally were born the Shapers:
    Triti -- Fate/time
    Diorix -- Angels
    Allucius -- Fae
    Adnamu -- Mortals
    Ricua -- Time
    Carosia -- Elementals
    Eliomara -- Trickery
    Licnos -- Darkness

As the shapers went to work, they drew the attention of the void lord Cthothoxr (Cth-otho-sher). The ka-gods went to war with the void and banished Cthothoxer outside their reality. Zuli-ka was killed in the conflict and Tagi-ka, fearing an imbalance, killed themself. Zuli-ka's body collapsed into the abyssal cyst that spawns demons, while Tagi-ka's will formed the Ordo, a barrier around reality that keeps the void lords out.

After the war the shapers resumed their work and built the canopany of Ka.

The shapers built the Cosmosphere, a forge nebula of stars and systems. The first system created was called Bastion and it was the home of the Angels, divine servitors to aid the shapers (demons were gestating and not yet revealed). Following Bastion was Arcadia, Conflux, and the Dark Star; homes of the Fae, Elementals, and Entropy respectivly.

While the mortal worlds were being created (the 7 planets orbiting the Mortal Star) demons erupted from the abyssal cyst and invaded the new worlds. The Shapers and their children went to war against the demons and while ultimately successful, their victory came at a cost. The shaper of Trickery, Eliomara, sealed themself in the abyssal cyst and formed a contract with the demons called the Decree of Ma (The illusory nature of all things) which bound them into their 'home'(prison).

The demons had succeded in partially corrupting the mortal worlds, cementing their presence there. The shapers continued on undaunted, they created the mortal races (not humans*) in their images and populated the worlds with their children. Thus began the first age.

The First Age -- Unity of Ka

The worlds of Sa (the primary star of the mortal worlds; meaning Hope of All Things) enjoyed the direct attentions of the shapers and benefited heavily from their guidence and the magical pathways they created to help the mortals transit the planets. The age ended with a demonic crusade that, while ultimately repelled, showed the shapers that the Decree of Ma was flawed, perhaps intentionally so. The shapers were forced to abandon their children as their own presence served as a catalyst for demoinc incursion. With the departure of the Shapers, the mortal races began to slowly decline and travel between worlds grew rarer and more dangerous (all the shaper's gifts were tained by the abyssal cyst).

The great war at the end saw the Elemental incarnates rise to prominence and lead mortal armies against the demons, this shifted the Aetherial balance away from the Fae and towards the elements.

The Second Age -- Rebirth of Sa and Age of Mortals

As the influence of the shapers waned, the mortal races were left to their own devices. Societies crumbled and fractured, famine and war became ever more prevalent, and the races grew distant. Eventually the regression was halted and the races began once again to progress, though without the shaper's wisdom to guide them this progress was halting and frought with dangers.

The Third Age -- Return of the Seeping Void and the Age of Man

Suddenly, as the races of Sa were rebuilding a massive void gate opened in the northern waters of the sanctuary planet Bali. From the gate streamed Humans, survivors of their own worlds which had been destroyed by the void lords, and, close on their heels, the Seeping Void itself. The Elemental incarnates were able to containe the void, but were corrupted by it in the process. The world of Bali became more dangerous as the elements themselves went mad.

Several hundreds years have passed since the third age began, the remaining Ka Gods have begun empowering mortal heroes, Shadow Breakers, to combat the void and rescue the incarnates from the void's influence.
