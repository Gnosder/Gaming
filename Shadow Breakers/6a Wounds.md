## Wounds, Recovery, and Death

Characters can be wounded in a number of ways, but usually when their stress reaches 0. Each wound has a name and a Severity (such as Bruised 1). When a character takes a wound they roll 2d6 and add the total severity of all their wounds and consult the following chart:

| Result | Wound  | Severity |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 2-6    | Minor  | 1        |
| 7-9    | Medium | 2        |
| 11-13  | Major  | 4        |
| 14+    | Death  | Death    |

Recovering from a wound takes time and rest. While magic can help speed up recovery it cannot (save for the most minor of wounds or greatest of magics) restore them instatly. During each long rest a Character reduces the severity of each wound by at least 1. This can be increased by bed rest, treatment, magic, or anything else that could assist.
