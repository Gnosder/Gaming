# Loot

All characters like loot. It takes many forms and can be used in many ways. It could be gold coins found in a lost horde, or a painting found in an art theif's den. It can be sold, or salvaged, or kept.

Due to the variety and versatility of loot it has a number of properties, both required and optional. The first required property is a name and description. Second the type of item that it is as well as its primary materials. Third is the items value (though this value may be obsqured by the GM). Optional properties are more specific, things like the culture it was made it, how old it is, any historical notes.

## Curency

Different cultures use different types of currency and assign different values to different items. Ecnomics is complicated, but there are ways to simplify it.

## Standard Trade Value

In general most items will be roughly as valuable to every culture -- baring specific events and scarcities -- and so a Standard Trade Value or STV can be applied to them. Many cultures have a standard currency which can be abstracted to the gold piece. Thus a single STV is worth about 1 gold piece.

Note that while some culture don't use gold, perhaps using carved jade instead, the value can still be abstracted to gold pieces.

Many cultures have several denominations of currency whether it be in sizes of coin, type of metal or gem, or something else. In those cases it can be easy to assume that the second smallest currency is a silver piece of which 10 make a GP and the third smallest is the copper piece, of which 100 make a GP.

Why base 10? Because it makes the math easier and a real amount of rigor is not needed. It can be assumed that everything (both loot and prices) is always converted into GP. However some versimilitude can be gained by handeling each currecny seperately. That said, the prices in this book will refelect the STV of an item.
