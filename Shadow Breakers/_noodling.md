2d6 + attribute
Don't roll to hit, roll for damage
    opposed by armor to TN
Group actions allow building up a die pool
    Less gross impact than if acting seperate but greater net impact

Damage and effect is equal to the degree of success over the TN
Position and Effect?
    Advantaged / Normal / Disadvantaged
    Critical Effect / Normal / Diminished Effect

Dice rolling
Most actions are 2d6 + stat
    bonus or penalty effects TN
Some actions add a 3rd d6 called the Effort Die. This usually costs stamina.
The GM has a doom pool that they can spend to impact the game.

The Doom clock and doom pool

The doom clock shows the agrigate total of Doom and stress for the players (but may also have other effects). The doom clock has 12 parts. The clock does not reduce on its own, only through player actions. Each part on the clock is a d6 the GM can use to impact the story. This pool refreshes with each encounter. If the party dallys or rests the clock can increase.

Doom Dice can be spent 1:1 to add a d6 to enemy actions or check TNs. Various steps on the clock also impose penalties on players.

Target Numbers and Armor

Target Numbers (TN) and armor are mostly the same. In order for a check to suceed it has to pass the number and the amount over the number is the degree of success. E.g. rolling a 9 against a TN of 7 is is a +2 DoS. Rolling a 9 against 7 armor does 2 damage. The average TN for most basic checks is 7.

Counter actions, reactions, and incidentles

Some actions can be taken when its not your turn. A reaction is a quick and reflexive action, like dodging, that can be taken during another characters turn and in response to their action. A counter action, like a counter attack, is a triggered action that happens when a check fails to roll above a TN. An incidentle is an action that can be triggered or provoked that doesn't fall into either of the two above catagories. Most of these actions can only be used once per round.

Counter Attack

If an attack fails to penetrate a target's armor the target gets to deal their counter attack damage to their attacker.

Dodge

As a reaction you can add a d6 to your armor rating.

Swift Blade

Daggers are fast weapons, each time you attack a target wielding a dagger they deal 1 damage to you.


If I kill the attack roll. How do you differentiate weapon types?
Categories: Light, Medium, Heavy (2/4/6 damage + abilities)

Rolls: 2d6 + stat | stat == skill (1-3/+2) + Equipment (1-3/+x)
    Skills are rated 1-3 and can have specialties
    Equipment are rated at 1-3 and can have bonues based on craftsmanship and magic
        Weapons are rated at +1/2/3 based on tier
        Gear is rated at +1/2/3 based on appropriateness?

Fate

If doom exists fate must too. Start with a number of fate (equal to level/tier?), gain some when the Doom Clock increases?

Fate == law | Doom == chaos

Experience

Gain exp when reducing the doom clock, making discoveries, completeing personal milestones (use Marvel Heroic as a basis?)


Crafting thoughts?
People tend to like crafting. Being able to make your own items is cool. Gathering resources, however, is not. What if when you found a resource in the wild, you just unlocked it for use. E.g. You find a peacebloom (Healing, Nature, Herb) in the wild and thus you unlock a check for each of those categories. Recipes will be like "Healing Potion: Base, Healing" and once you have both of those things unlocked you can craft them with just gold and time. So this replaces farming reagents with an unlock system that rewards discovery.

Planning Table?
Essentially taking the war tables from WoW (sending followers out on quests) and implementing them in an RPG. Followers would have a Tier, a Rating, a Role, and an ability. They would also require downtime between missions. You would send a handful of followers on a mission (along with some gold for supplies and wages) and they would report back (if they survive).


Die rolling and levers
    "Rolls: 2d6 + stat | stat == skill (1-3/+2) + Equipment (1-3/+x)
    Skills are rated 1-3 and can have specialties
    Equipment are rated at 1-3 and can have bonues based on craftsmanship and magic
        Weapons are rated at +1/2/3 based on tier
        Gear is rated at +1/2/3 based on appropriateness?"
    
    This means skills are rated at 0-3 (+2) for specialty and equipment is rated at 0-3. Penalties would be 0-(-6). Dis/advantage would be +1d6 H/L. Magic bonus 0-3.

    Rolls are 3d6 + (-6) - 11 H/L add Hero Die for certain actions (d8)

    Change die dize to d10 (d12 hero die), bonuses from  skill: 0-5(+2), item 0-5, Magic 0-5, penalty 0-10
    This gives 2d10 -10 to +17 (w/o hero == max 37, w/ hero == max 49)
        Early game: +4 / base DC 14
        Mid game: +8 / 18
        End game: +15 / 25
    Crit on 18+ (~6%, ~ 14%, ~1%)

Compare system levers:
    WoD: dice pool, att (1-5) + skill (-3-5) + item + Merit + Misc
    Shadowrun: dice pool, att(1-9) + skill(1-7) + item + misc
    DnD5: d20 + att (-1-5) + Prof (2-5) + magic (0-3)
    pathfinder: d20 + att (-1-11) + skills (0-23) + magic (0-11)

A role playing game by Gnosdy

Uses positve attrition. Heroic Roleplay. Build resources by playing. Victories make you stronger and turn into exp. 
When building characters: choose a powersource (Martial, Primal, Divine, Arcane, Occult) which determines how you generate resources. 
On long Rest: Regain all HP, loose all resources and victories, gain XP depending on victories.

Kill the null result?
    Null Result == You miss, next.
    Attacks auto hit, roll damage

Story telling system. 
Positive attrition
Victories
Degrading will
Powersource, role, camp role
Mana, stamina, Will
Will == HP. Temp and Max. As you take damage your temp decreases, when it hits zero you roll your current max, on pass it drops by one and refills your temp up to your new max.
    Massive damage == wounds which auto degrade will and impose a penalty
Stamina == WoD willpower. Expend for +3 to a roll, recover through victories
Mana == personal mana battery, small pool, refills every few minutes or on taking channel action.
Victories == can be cashed out for XP. Can regenerate Will and Stamina. Can power certain abilities.
XP == Victories + Current Will.
Full Rest == takes ~1 week, cash out victories, refill will to max.
Armor == extra will that is lost first
Aspirations grant extra victories when completed
saves: max will + current will

No attributes, only skills? WoD does att + Skill + misc. What about skill + will!

How does magic work? Aether is created by life and the WYLD, it is drawn from the world by users who shape it into effects and release it. Users can only hold so much at one time and have to channel more (draw it in) when their reserve runs dry. Shaping magic requires an imago (an image of what the spell will do, along with its effects; the better the imago the stronger the spell). Using a spell says something about the user. You can't use magic you don't belive in. If using a spell that goes against the casters nature, something happens.

    Spells have: A target, an effect, a radius, a range, tags
    When casting a spell choose a rote spell or free cast.
    When free casting: Choose a target, define an effect (one or more), determine power. Mana cost equals Effects + power and action roll equals power.
    Rote spells already define effects, determine target and power. Mana cost is power + rote discount. Action roll is power.


Spell Effects:
    Reflective:
        Knowing
    Tier 0:
        Damage (Fraying)
    Tier 1: 
        Shielding
        Debuffing (Unraveling)
        Veiling
        Control (Shape, aspected damage, duration)
        Healing
    Tier 2:
        Alter (Weaving)
        Summoning/ Conjuration
        Perfecting
    Tier 3:
        Making
        Unmaking

You can know and sense phenomenom reactivly or activly (reactive is limited). Damage is T0 becasue you're just blasting a target with Aether (you can shape it at T1 and deal aspected damage at T1). Duration is instant by default and can be made concentration for free. Increase duration steps by taking effect.

When taking an action, make an action roll. Combat: Pass x2 damage, fail x1 damage


# What is a game?

I sit down at the table with my friends. We play a game. We gather character sheets. We tell stories. All stories have conflict. When a moment of conflict arises players want to ACT (to take action) this calls for a decision engine (traditionally this means rolling dice). I do X. Make an X check to see how that action goes. This check usually says succeed or fail. What does that mean?

When I attempt to climb a mountain and pass, I climb the mountain. When I fail do I fall? Do I stand in place? What does failure mean? In practice it means something has to happen and it's not what the character intended.

Make a roll, add a number compare to DC. This is not a bad way to do things
