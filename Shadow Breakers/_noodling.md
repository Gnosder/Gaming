2d6 + attribute
Don't roll to hit, roll for damage
    opposed by armor to TN
Group actions allow building up a die pool
    Less gross impact than if acting seperate but greater net impact

Damage and effect is equal to the degree of success over the TN

Dice rolling
Most actions are 2d6 + stat
    bonus or penalty effects TN
Some actions add a 3rd d6 called the Effort Die. This usually costs stamina.
The GM has a doom pool that they can spend to impact the game.

The Doom clock and doom pool

The doom clock shows the agrigate total of Doom and stress for the players (but may also have other effects). The doom clock has 12 parts. The clock does not reduce on its own, only through player actions. Each part on the clock is a d6 the GM can use to impact the story. This pool refreshes with each encounter. If the party dallys or rests the clock can increase.

Doom Dice can be spent 1:1 to add a d6 to enemy actions or check TNs. Various steps on the clock also impose penalties on players.

Target Numbers and Armor

Target Numbers (TN) and armor are mostly the same. In order for a check to suceed it has to pass the number and the amount over the number is the degree of success. E.g. rolling a 9 against a TN of 7 is is a +2 DoS. Rolling a 9 against 7 armor does 2 damage. The average TN for most basic checks is 7.

Counter actions, reactions, and incidentles

Some actions can be taken when its not your turn. A reaction is a quick and reflexive action, like dodging, that can be taken during another characters turn and in response to their action. A counter action, like a counter attack, is a triggered action that happens when a check fails to roll above a TN. An incidentle is an action that can be triggered or provoked that doesn't fall into either of the two above catagories. Most of these actions can only be used once per round.

Counter Attack

If an attack fails to penetrate a target's armor the target gets to deal their counter attack damage to their attacker.

Dodge

As a reaction you can add a d6 to your armor rating.

Swift Blade

Daggers are fast weapons, each time you attack a target wielding a dagger they deal 1 damage to you.


If I kill the attack roll. How do you differentiate weapon types?
Categories: Light, Medium, Heavy (2/4/6 damage + abilities)

Rolls: 2d6 + stat | stat == skill (1-3/+2) + Equipment (1-3/+x)
    Skills are rated 1-3 and can have specialties
    Equipment are rated at 1-3 and can have bonues based on craftsmanship and magic
        Weapons are rated at +1/2/3 based on tier
        Gear is rated at +1/2/3 based on appropriateness?

Fate

If doom exists fate must too. Start with a number of fate (equal to level/tier?), gain some when the Doom Clock increases?

Fate == law | Doom == chaos

Experience

Gain exp when reducing the doom clock, making discoveries, completeing personal milestones (use Marvel Heroic as a basis?)


Crafting thoughts?
People tend to like crafting. Being able to make your own items is cool. Gathering resources, however, is not. What if when you found a resource in the wild, you just unlocked it for use. E.g. You find a peacebloom (Healing, Nature, Herb) in the wild and thus you unlock a check for each of those categories. Recipes will be like "Healing Potion: Base, Healing" and once you have both of those things unlocked you can craft them with just gold and time. So this replaces farming reagents with an unlock system that rewards discovery.

Planning Table?
Essentially taking the war tables from WoW (sending followers out on quests) and implementing them in an RPG. Followers would have a Tier, a Rating, a Role, and an ability. They would also require downtime between missions. You would send a handful of followers on a mission (along with some gold for supplies and wages) and they would report back (if they survive).


Die rolling and levers
    "Rolls: 2d6 + stat | stat == skill (1-3/+2) + Equipment (1-3/+x)
    Skills are rated 1-3 and can have specialties
    Equipment are rated at 1-3 and can have bonues based on craftsmanship and magic
        Weapons are rated at +1/2/3 based on tier
        Gear is rated at +1/2/3 based on appropriateness?"
    
    This means skills are rated at 0-3 (+2) for specialty and equipment is rated at 0-3. Penalties would be 0-(-6). Dis/advantage would be +1d6 H/L. Magic bonus 0-3.

    Rolls are 3d6 + (-6) - 11 H/L add Hero Die for certain actions (d8)

    Change die dize to d10 (d12 hero die), bonuses from  skill: 0-5(+2), item 0-5, Magic 0-5, penalty 0-10
    This gives 2d10 -10 to +17 (w/o hero == max 37, w/ hero == max 49)
        Early game: +4 / base DC 14
        Mid game: +8 / 18
        End game: +15 / 25
    Crit on 18+ (~6%, ~ 14%, ~1%)

Compare system levers:
    WoD: dice pool, att (1-5) + skill (-3-5) + item + Merit + Misc
    Shadowrun: dice pool, att(1-9) + skill(1-7) + item + misc
    DnD5: d20 + att (-1-5) + Prof (2-5) + magic (0-3)
    pathfinder: d20 + att (-1-11) + skills (0-23) + magic (0-11)
