# Introduction

The world of Avun rests on a fissure in space through which agents of the Seeping Doom slink from. As such the people of Avun are constatnly beset by despolic tyrants, vile cults, savage creatures of nightmare, and more horrors of the Seeping Doom. Fortunately the stregnth of mortals is far from spent and heroes stand against the darkness. These heroes are known as Shadow Breakers.

Not all Shadow Breakers chose the life of a hero, but it chose them and the Seeping Doom knows it. As a Shadow Breaker, whether you are trying to save the world or just survive another day, your job is to resist the corrupting influence of the Seeping Doom.

Shadow Breakers is a game about heroes and rouges, doom and destiny. Defie the darkness, rediscover the history it tries to hide, and blaze your trail.

## Playing the Game

### Core Mechanic

The core mechanic of the game is quite simple, both in its use and potential effect, fortunatly there are a few variations that add to its power.

Simply put: for any action a character takes

### The Doom Clock

The Seeping Doom has many agents. Some are clear, like an eldritch abomonation with hooks and tentecles, while others are more subtle, like growing unrest in a town. The Doom Clock is a device the GM uses to show just how those agents are progressing and how close they are to acheiving their aims and just how dire things have become for the characters. As the stakes and tension increase the GM fills in sections on the Doom Clock. This grants the GM increasing powers to influence the game and can impose penalties on the characters.

Fortunatley Shadow Breakers can roll back this clock to prevent it from striking DOOM. Actions taken against the Seeping Doom and its agents can remove sections from the clock and even reduce it entierly. This is the main mechanical conflict of Shadow Breakers, combat the Doom clock so that it never fills entierly.

### Obligations, motivations, and Goals

People are complex. Everyone has things that motivate them, goals they wish to meet to grow, and obligations that weigh on them. Each of these is important and worth exploring. Characters in Shadow Breakers have them all. 

When creating charcters players not only customize their character's abilities, but who that character is by chosing a motivation, setting a goal and determining any obligations. Each of these has both narrative and mechanical implications, meaning they impact both the story and the game.

#### Motivations

As simple as "aquire wealth" to as complex as "serve the values of the church of immortal flames" or as vauge as "be succesful" everyone has a motivation. The thing that drives them to act in their life. Motivations can change as people change, but they always have at least one. In Shadow Breakers you choose one when you create your character to push them. Mechanically those who act towards their motivation are rewarded by fate.

#### Goals

Where as a motivation drives a character a goal is a more concrete aspiration. It is something your character wants to do right now or works towards. For example if your motivation is "aquire wealth" a goal might be to "sell your loot for a good price" or if your motivation is "serve the values of the church of immortal flames" your goal might be to "spread the word the Flame to the Hamlet or Orlaine". A character can have multiple goals at a time and they can change fairly often. Mechanically completing a goal often rewards experience with more difficult goals rewarding the most.

#### Obligations

Not everything you choose for your character is good. Characters often have debts that can take many forms from physical debts to addictions, to family ties, to crimal records and more. The unifing theme is that an obligation is something a character has wheter they like it or not. Mechanically there is a chance for a character's obligation to come up in play which can cause the character to suffer penalties, strain, or might even increase the Doom clock.

Most obligations can be reduced or removed through play affording characters something to work towards and granting a sense of relief when they are dealt with.

### Experience and Development

You gain experience in one of several ways. First and most importantly you gain experience when you lower the doom clock. This is perhaps the simplest and most basic way to gain experience, it is also the most efficent. A second, though lesser way to gain experience is to make discoveries such as finding landmarks, exploring places of interest, or gaining lore and knowledge.

Experience can be spent to increase your character's level as well as unlock or improve abilities, traits, and skills. In shadow breakers your level determines your health and mana as well as what abilities you can have and how high your skills can be. After each level up you must spend at least a set amount of experience on abilities, traits, and skills before you can level up again.
