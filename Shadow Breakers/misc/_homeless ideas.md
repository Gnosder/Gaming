# Victories

Finally, Victories track a character's Triumphs. Each victory serves to enbolden a character, driving them to even greater heights. Victories reset during a long rest and are converted into experience.

### Abilities and Magic

Magic is everywhere and in everything and even those who do not walk the path of the Magi can still use it and be effected by it. WHile most characters will have abilities that use SP, which are magic, only the ones who choose to become Magi (by purchasing the required merit) can shape magic to their wills.

Magi gain a few things that others do not have. First they gain an additional mana track, called Aura, which tracks how much of the ambient magic they have absorbed into themselves. Second, they gain a tradition, focus, and bane which describe how they learn magic, what their magic specializes in, and what magics or acts are anathma to them. Finally, A magi can learn spells (Often reffered to as Rote spells) which they are trained in and can use at will. Magi can also cast spells they haven't learned, though doing so can be dangerous.
