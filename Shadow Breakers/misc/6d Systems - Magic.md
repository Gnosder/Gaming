# Systems - Magic

How to use Magic:

1. Choose the spell you wish to cast and determine if you are casting a known rote spell or are improvising the spell.
1b. For an improvised spell you may also build it off the improvised spell table.

If you are casting a rote spell:

As a Swift 

2a. Choose targets for the spell, which defense it will target (Defense, Physical, Mental), and determine the intended effect.
3a. Expend Aura equal to its cost, as determined by the rote being cast.
4a. Expend additional mana in steps equal to the spell's level to increase your casting bonus and paradox by 1 per extra step.

As a Standard Action

    *Spells are always succesfully cast, the roll is to determine if it effects the target or not.

5a. Make a spell attack roll targeting the correct defence. The roll is 2d6 plus power plus your implement's tool bonus plus 1 for each X addional mana you spent plus any other bonuses or penalties.
    * Note: If you have the spell's focus, you gain +1 to the check.
6a. If there is any paradox on the spell, compare your roll and the amount of paradox to the Paradox Table and amend the spell's effect with the results.
7a. If the spell attack roll is greater than the targeted defense the spell effects the target. If the spell did damage, the amount of damage it deals is equal to the difference between the target's defense and the attack roll plus any other bonuses or penalties however, many rotes have a maxium amount of damage they can deal. Expending any extra mana removes that limit.

If you are casting an improvised spell.
2a. Choose targets for the spell, which defense it will target (Defense, Physical, Mental), and determine the intended effect.
3a. Expend Aura equal to double its cost, as determined by the spell being cast, and add that much paradox to the roll.
4a. Expend additional mana in steps equal to the spell's level to increase your casting bonus and paradox by 2 per extra step.

As a Standard Action

    *Spells are always succesfully cast, the roll is to determine if it effects the target or not.

5b. Make a spell attack roll targeting the correct defence. The roll is 2d6 plus the LOWEST of any applicable traditions plus your implement's tool bonus plus 1 for each addional mana you spent plus any other bonuses or penalties.
    * Note: If you DO NOT have the spell's focus, you suffer a -2 penalty to the check.
6b. If there is any paradox on the spell, compare your roll and the amount of paradox to the Paradox Table and amend the spell's effect with the results.
7b. If the spell attack roll is greater than the targeted defense the spell effects the target. If the spell did damage, the amount of damage it deals is equal to the difference between the target's defense and the attack roll plus any other bonuses or penalties.
