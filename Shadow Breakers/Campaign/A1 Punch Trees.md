# Gotta Punch  Trees

Every game needs to start the same way: punching trees. Or, rather, pruning some rampaging dryads and weed spirits.

We start in the small hamlet of Trimerly where a group volunteers have agreed to help reclaim the town's Orchard from some wild spirits.

# Trimerly

Ordinary day, the ochard is being bothered by dryad's but no one is really bothered (it'll be dealt with in time). Meet the Mayor, Sherif, Wood Speaker, and Berry Picker.

## Mayor, Pora Maso

Town elder that oversees the whole of the area. Good spirit, hard to bother. A Mossy Sauren.

## Sherif, Powa Raga

Keeps the peace in the town, doesn't do too much, but cares a great deal. An Elf.

## Wood Speaker, Yakamup Moi

Druid / Nature cleric. Keeps the peace of the forest and keeps the town in harmony with the wilds. A Mossy Sauren.

## Berry Picker, Ronga Taneti

An affectionate title for the head farmer of the town. Primarily deals in fruits and berries. A Firbol.

# The Orchard

Kill 5 Wild Dryads and their spirit helpers, harvest sacred ash wood, and then purify the Dryad's hedge.
In the ochard there are 3 Dryad's and their spirits causing mishchef (they want to return the area to wild nature). The dryads are mostly unconcered with what is happening around them so they can be dealt with seperatly.

The sacred ash tree is being corrupted by a dyrad (growing thorny weeds up its trunk). A branch can be taken without harming the tree.

The hedge is erupting into a new (larger) dryad and spirits. Burn the ash near the hedge and let its smoke ease the spirits of nature.

# Through the Trees

Somewhere in the neat rows of fruit trees wild dryads and their weed spirit helpers are causing miscief. The 3 dryads aren't paying attention to anything other than their task (which is to make the area wild, sprouting weeds and causing the neatly pruned trees to grow wild).

# The Sacred Ash

At the back of the Orchard is a large Ash tree. Its bark and Leaves are used by the Wood Speaker to appease the spirits of the area. Festivals are often held around it. A path snakes through the orchard toward it. A single dryad is smothering the tree with weeds.

# The Dryad's Hedge

A little ways out of the Orchard is a wlid and thorny shrub from which the dryads arose. It is in the process of growing a new, larger dryad, but will release it only partially formed if disturbed. At the site of the hedge a raven bone fetish is found, hinting this may not have been natural after all.

## Wind Down

The Fetish suggests that this was not, in fact, natural. The mayor sends the characters to meet a Seer/Witch-doctor nearby in order to divine its purpose and origin. This leads to A2.
