# The Darkening of Trimerly

After the discovery of the fetish, sabotage is suspected, but there are no suspects. The group, who thus far have proven capable, are sent to a Seer that is not too far out of town. The seer is missing and there are signs of a struggle. Upon returning to town the heroes are acosted by bandits who were hired to burn the town's Sacred Ash. The advance party was just scouts for the larger group that will attack that night. Signs point towards a ruined castle several days away and the mysterious stranger who moved in there.
