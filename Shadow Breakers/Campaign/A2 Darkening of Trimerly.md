# The Darkening of Trimerly

After the discovery of the fetish, sabotage is suspected, but there are no suspects. The group, who thus far have proven capable, are sent to a Seer that is not too far out of town. The seer is missing and there are signs of a struggle. Upon returning to town the heroes are acosted by bandits who were hired to burn the town's Sacred Ash. The advance party was just scouts for the larger group that will attack that night. Signs point towards a ruined castle several days away and the mysterious stranger who moved in there.

## The Seer

The road to the seer is more wild than normal; as if the whole of the forest is going feral. Difficulties abound between magically overgrown plants and frezied beasts.

After arriving at the Seer's hut it becomes apparent that the Seer is gone. A number of clues can be found pointing to what happened. Signs of a struggle are obvious.

## Back to Trimerly

If return to Trimerly to check in:
A group of bandits is scouting the town out and can be caught offguards by the party. The town is attacked at night by a larger force of bandits. The bandit's goals are: Burn the Ash if it's not corrupted, burn the store house, Burn the Elder's Lodge.

# The Stranger

Signs point towards an abandoned Red Sauran fortress, but the fetish is not Sauren in nature. Rumors swirl of a stranger who has moved in there.
