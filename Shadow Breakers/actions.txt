The combat system is as follows:

1. The GM determines inititive and surprise.
    This is done in a way that makes narrative sense. E.g. a hiden character uses steath, etc.

2. Starting from the lowest value (the slowest combatant) each character, in turn, declares and 
resolves a swift action.

3. Starting from the highest value (the fastest combatant) each character, in turn, declares and 
resolves a standard action.

4. The GM resolves the round.

Repeat step 2-4 until the conflict ends. 

*Note that any time before a character takes their standard action they can choose to sacrifice
it and take an Abort Action instead.
** Actions can fail based on how others react to them.
*** Some actions (casting a spell) take both a character's swift and standard action.
