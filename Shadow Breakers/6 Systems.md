Notes:
- IGNORE Anti-death spiral, the lower a characters Will the harder it gets for them to die.
- When a character reaches 0 Stress they are stunned. On each of their turns they make a will check, on a failure they remain stunned, on a pass they may act on their turn.



# Chapter 6 - Systems

## Basic Action resolution

The game uses between 2 and 10 10-sided (d10) dice to resolve all actions. When a character takes an action the GM may call for an action check and will state the characterisic(s) being tested. Action checks can be Simple, Contested, or Complex. If only one characteristic is called for the second will always be Will.

### Simple Action Checks

When asked to make a simple action check the player consults their character's sheet and builds a die pool equal to their combined rating in the 2 characteristics.

    Example: The GM calls for an Athletics check, and Davoc has athletics 3 and Will 3, so Davoc's player rolls 6 d10.

When rolling dice you count the number of successes rolled, where any value of 7+ is considered a success and a 10 is counted as 2 successes. For a simple check only 1 success is needed.

    Example: Davoc's player rolls 6 d10 and gets the results 2,4,5,5,8,10. Thus, Davoc have acheived 2 successes.

Sometimes the GM might rule there are bonuses or penalties to the roll based on the narrative. In that case the value is added to or subtracted from the dice pool before it is rolled.

Particularly challenging actions may require more than one success.

### Contested Action Checks

A contested action check works the same as a simple check, however, instead of needing only 1 success the player must roll more successes then their opponent.

    Example: Davoc is in an arm wrestling match with the tavern's bouncer, the GM calls for a contested Athletics check. Davoc has Athletics 3 and Will 3, but is slightly drunk and gets -1. The bouncer has Athletics 3 and Will 1. Thus Davoc's player will roll 5 d10 while the GM will roll 4 for the bouncer. Davoc gets 2 success and the bouncer gets 1, thus Davoc wins the contest.

### Complex Action Checks

Sometimes an action cannot be resolved all at once, in that case the GM will call for a Complex action check and determine the time it takes for each attempt, the number of successes needed to complete the action, and the number of failed rolls to fail it. If the character receives the needed success before reaching the number of failed rolls, they succeed at the action, otherwise they fail. Time passes based on how many rolls are made.

    A failed roll is a roll that does not generate at least 1 success.

    Example: Bo is crafting throwing bombs, the GM decides it will be a complex crafting check, each roll will take 1 hour, and Bo needs 4 successes before 2 failed rolls. Bo's Crafting + Will is 7, thus Bo's player rolls 7 d10. If they roll 2 successes, 0 success, 1 success, and 1 success then they have rolled 4 times and got 4 total success and 1 failed roll. Thus Bo succeeds in crafting his bombs and takes 4 hours to do so.

Sometimes an action cannot fail, but just takes time, and sometimes an action cannot fail outright but can get harder the more they fail action rolls. In the first case the player will continue making rolls until they acheive the number of successes and then the GM will determine how much time the action took based on the number of rolls made. In the second case each failed roll adds 1 to the number of successes need to complete the action.

    Example: Grinhilda is brewing Healing potions for her free clinic. The GM decides that she can't fail outright and so calls for a complex crafting action, where each check take 1 hour, she needs 4 successes, and each failure will add 1 to the number of successes she needs. If her player rolls 1 success, 0 success, 2 successes, and 1 success then Grinhilda still hasn't succeeded because, while she did get 4 successes, her 1 failure increases the number she needs to 5, thus her player needs to keep rolling.

### 10 dice

No action can roll more than 10 dice. If a player would roll more than 10 dice, they do the following:
1. Gain 1 automatic success to the action.
2. Subtract 2 dice from the pool.
3. If there is still more than 10 dice in the pool, repeat from step one. Otherwise, roll the pool.

## Characteristics

### Will and Will Points

Each character has a Will score between 1 and 5 that denotes thier resolve, destiny, and/or heroic ability. The Will score is one of the most important characteristics and directly corelates to how powerful a character is. 

Each character also has Will Points (stress) which they lose by taking damage or as consequences for failure.

When a character's stress reaches 0 or they take damage while their stress is 0, they make a Will check. Success in a Will check has a different meaning than normal. If they succeed at a Will check their Will degrades by 1 and they refill their stress to max. If they fail there is no effect.

When a characters Will reaches 0, that character begins to die.

Characters fully reginerate stress after a short rest and rully reginerate Will after a Long rest.

    This means that as a characters Will gets lower they have a progressivly better chance to NOT lose more Will.

    Example: Gene has just been reduced to 0 stress in a fight. He has a Will of 4, so his player rolls 4 d10 to see if his Will degrades. The dice come up 1, 3, 4, and 9. Gene's Will degrades and drops to 3. His stress replensihes to its max value of 8.

### Stamina

Each character has Stamina points rated from 0-10. At any time a character can expend a stamina point to gain one of the following effects:

    Note: Only 1 stamina may be spent a round.

- Gain +3 to a die roll
- Ignore their wounds for 1 minute.
- Recover 5 stress.

Stamina replensishes by 1 every time a victory is earned or after a full night's rest. It fully replenishes after a long rest.

### Mana

Mana is the Aether that collects inside organic beings. Beings that can produce Aether can store mana. Thus every character has mana. All beings can use mana, but only some can use it consicouly and evern fewer can shape it into spells. A character can hold a maximum of 10 mana by default and generate 1 point each day, any excess is lost.

Characters without Adept or Spellcasting abilities can expend mana in a few ways:

    Note: Each of these is largely reflexive.

- Through Oblation, prayer, or exaltation characters tithe a portion of their mana to the source of their devotion.
- In especially stressful or dangerous situations characters expend a single point of mana to reroll 1 failed die.
- While sick or wounded a character expends up to 1 mana a day to gain an extra chance to recover from wounds.

### Skills

Skills are rated from 0 to 5 and can each have one specilization.

The list of skills is as follows:
- Arcane
- Athletics
- Background
- Casting
- Craft
- Deception
- Diplomacy
- Empathy
- Fighting
- Intimidation
- Lore
- Nature
- Occult
- Perception
- Performance
- Religion
- Society
- Stealth
- Survival
- Thievery

Skills can only be improved once per level up and learning or improving a skill takes a number of Skill Points equal to its new rating.

    Example: Emerald wants to improve her nature skill from 3 to 4, this will cost her 4 points since the new rating of the skill she wants is 4.

A character can only specialize in skills they have at least 1 point in and they may only have 1 specialization per skill. Specialization requires 2 skill points. Specializations add +1 to a characters skill total or +2 if the skill is rated 4 or higher.

#### Skill List

##### Arcane
##### Athletics
##### Background
##### Casting
##### Craft
##### Deception
##### Diplomacy
##### Empathy

Attempting to understand and share a person's desires, and emotions is empathy. This skill is useful to learn the intentions of another person (e.g. if they are lying or have ultierior motives) and for learning if a character has 'social locks' and what they are.


##### Fighting
##### Intimidation

### Merits and Abilities

### Victories

When characters triumph over their foes, resolve conflicts, or complete challenging objectives they earn a victory which increase their abilities. With each victory their heroic inertia increases. These victories stay with characters until they take a long rest and then are converted into experience.

Some encounters or goals can grant more than 1 victory.

## Combat

### Healing and Recovery

Characters get hurt. They often get hurt a lot. Such is the price of adventure.

Will and stress represent a characters strength of will, resilence, and pain tolerance. It is essentially the heroic ability for characters to continue on inspite of hardship and injury.

Will, the main score that denotes a character's full strength and the maximum stress they can have before they die, can only be restored with a long rest. Some powerful magics and abilities can make exceptions, but those are costly and rare.

Stress on the other hand, which is a character's reserve of will power, can fluctuate quite a bit. It is generally lost often and any time a character takes damage or suffers the consequence of failure. That said, it is often easy to recover. Stress can be recovered in the following ways:

- After a short rest characters can recover an amount of stress equal to 5 plus their victories. This can only ocure once per hour.
- Mundane and Magical healing has the ability to restore stress.
- Many character abilities allow the character to restore stress regularly throughout a conflict.
- A character can expend a point of stamina to restore 5 stress.

### Wounds

While Will represents a characters strength of will, resilence, and pain tolerance there are other factors that play in to the health of a character. These factors can be broken up into physical wounds, the physical damage a charater takes, and metnal wounds, the mental and social damage a character takes. When a character suffers a wound they gain a trait that names the wound and a score denoting its severity. Wounds are long lasting taking long rest or more to heal completely, short term wounds (i.e. persitant damage) does not count when tallying Wounds.

Each time a character loses stress they lose additional stress equal to the sum value of their wounds. Each time a character fails an action they lose stress equal to the sum value of their wounds.

Wounds can be suffered in a variety of ways:

- Suffering a critical hit.
- Being injured while dying.
- Making a noble sacrifice.

### Death and Dying

When a character's Will reaches 0, their resolve has broken and they begin to die. A dying character can take no actions and goes into shock during which they are immobalized. Each round a character is in shock they roll a single die, on a success they stabalize, on a failure they move closer to death. A character can fail a number of death saves equal to their maximum Will score, these failures persist until the character takes a long rest.

If a dying character takes damage they suffer a wound and automatically fail a number of death saves equal to the damage taken.

A stable character is no longer dying, but cannot recover stress, stamina, or mana until their Will rises to at least 1. Without aid this will happen in 1 day.

## Social

Social Locks. Every NPC has 'social locks', barriers that they either purposly or not put up around themselves. Everytime an NPC is asked to do something, they throw up a lock. The more uncomfortable the request, the more locks. In order to get an NPC to do something, you must open each of the locks they have placed. Mechanically this means overcoming a skill check for EACH lock. Narrativly this means pursuading, cajoling, empathizing, etc. with the character.

    Example: The heros are attempting to pursuade Daedric to tell them about his employer. Daedric does not trust the heroes, has been asked not to discuss his employer, and isn't particularly keen on having any kind of relationship with the muscle he hires. Thus he has 3 locks, each must be bypassed seperatley in order to get him to divulge the information.

There are two ways to attempt to open a lock. The first is to brute force it, this is hard but fast, and typically takes the form of standard skill checks; either pursuading, deceiving, or intimidating. Success there can temporarily open the lock. The second method is slower, but easier. It typically starts by trying to figure out what the locks are, often through an empathy check, and then attempting to address each one in turn.

    Example: If the heroes want to attempt to brute force their way past Daedric's locks, they might have to 

### Languages

There are 2 main states of a language Common and Discreat. These states give a -1 or +0 respectivly to rolls. Attempting to communicate without a shared language requires an Empathy/Background check.

Common language are also reffered to as Pigin or Trade languages. These languages are used widley accross different societies and regions. Due to their simplicity they are not as verbose as True languages.

Discret languages are what is normally thought of as a language. English, French, Elvish, Dwarven are examples. A lagnuage, in its simplist form, allows two parties to communicate effectivly. Discret languages do not confer bonuses, but neither do they suffer penalties to communication.
