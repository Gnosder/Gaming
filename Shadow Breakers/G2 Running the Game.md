# Running the Game

This chapter is geared towards Game masters and details game specific considerations as well as general best practices and tips.

## Random Encounters

Sometimes things happen out in the world. There are 3 main zoom levels for random encounters: regional, local, site Based. Regional are for overland and hex travel. Encounters at this level can be settlements, points of interest, or wandering monsters. The site based level is for things that can happen within a discrete location or dungeon and typically include just wandering monsters. The Local level exists between regional and site based and can be a mix of both.

To determine random encounters roll the Doom Pool. If any of the dice show a 1, there is an encounter. Read the dice as they land from left to right ignoring the first 1 that is rolled. Consult the following table using the dice as needed. If you run out of dice, simply roll the doom pool again and use those values.

Note that this table is a general guide. Sometimes there are more than 6 possible encounters the table will indicate how many dice to use (i.e. d6, 2d6, 3d6).

General Random Encounter Tables
| Roll | Number d4 | Number d8 |


When building random encounter tables each encounter should specify what extra columns to consult.

Example: Explorations in Redridge Mountains
    A party is exploring Redridge mountains. The doom pool is currently at 5d6. The GM rolls for a random encounter. They roll the doom pool and, reading the dice from left to right, see 4,4,2,1,1. Since a 1 was rolled there is a random encounter. They then consult the random encounter table for the area (EX 1.1). Starting from left to right they see a 4 which maps to "Dire Boar (d4)(Aggressive)(BT)" This means the encounter is Dire Boar, there are d4 of them, they are aggressive, consulte the beast task (BT) column. The GM takes the next die, 4, and consults the BT column getting a value of "Foraging". Thus the party encounters d4 foraging Direboars.
