A zombie game with community building (ala State of Decay), Random-lite town generation (ala ZZZ).

# Noodling

Why is Initiative a seperate roll? What if the first check in combat was ALSO used for initiative?

# Town Generation

Build towns/zones with cards like in "Betrayal in the House on the Hill" and "Zenless Zone Zero". Ohh! And Tarot. A tarot like method for building locations; building exploration zones. Not combat zones though, combat maps will be seperate.
