Season One: A Great Wind Blows
By Patrick Plaisted


## Chapter One: What type of game is Teralon
	Teralon is a homebrewed world created by Patrick “Gnosder” Plaisted. It’s designed as a high fantasy world and draws inspiration from multiple sources including Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Runeterra (by Riot games), Final Fantasy 14, and others (see Appendix N for a complete list).
	Season one starts on the Dontursk subcontinent of Aglia and moves to the northern tip of Shur. The story centers around the expansion of the Lumineros Church out of Shur and the sudden appearance of an entrenched shadowcult.

## Chapter Two: Welcome to Teralon
	Teralon is a big place, here’s what you need to know.

Geography
Aglia
Is a small peninsula to the south of Kaar and surrounded by the Central Baticsia Ocean. In the north the landscape is dotted with hills, mountains, streams and lakes while the south is mostly flat with gently rolling hills. The region gets around 25 inches of rain a year and so is very green in the summer and coated in snow in the winter.
The area has strong commerce thanks to its many rivers which allow easy transportation of goods and its vast forests.
[Similar to real world Denmark in the south and Sweden in the North]
Shur
Shur is a desert state just north of the equator. A large river, the Nagris, runs north out of the Blasted Lands. The region is typically divided into Upper Shur (which is to the south and contains low mountains and rocky desert and Lower Shur (which is to the north and made of wide valley around the Nagris surrounded by rolling dunes
Shur is known as a breadbasket region thanks to the Nagris and houses many skilled artesans, mines, and quarries.
[Similar to real world Egypt]
History
Aglia
Mostly known as a feudal state Aglia is home to noble houses and knights. Its history is full of civalrous warfare. It was breifly invaded by the Virmari empire, but was able to repel the assault.
Shur
Formerly a vassel state of the Virmari empire Shur gained its independence when the empire fell two decades ago. Now Shur is undergoing a rebirth of sorts as they explore their new freedom. Recently a group of anti-Virmari rebels known as the Lumeneris have gained a cult like status and have begun to aggresivly spread.
Religion and Mythology
A number of religions are prominent in the area. All are part of a polithesistic diaspora, but place greater emphasis on some areas than others. The governing pantheon of Teralon is the ‘Greyhawk’ deities (see appendix C) it is not widely known if they are real but divine magic hints they might be.

The Circle of Roots - A druidic or wiccan religion that venerates blood ties and nature. Their principle Goddess is Istus, but they also venerate Celestian, Ehlonna, and Wee Jas. The circle is decentralized and is often thought of as a hedge religion rather than a ‘propper’ religion. However, the membership of the circle, while hard to count, is believed to be 30-50% of the population of Aglia.
Architects of Roses - This religion was practiced almost exclusivly by the Fae until the Elven clans Achine (on the west coast of Aglia) joined the kingdom. Now the Architects are the primary religion of the region. It mirrors the feudal caste structure and places a heavy emphasis on chivalry, bargains, and fealty. Their gospel, the Book of Roses, is a parable of Arcadian heroes. Their Gods tend to be Heironeous, Olidammara, and Boccob.
The Lumeneris - A new religion born from the teachings of an anti-virmari rebel cell leader named Leona Victus. They are an aggressive religion whos rites are steeped in fire metaphors. Its teaching focus on the deeds of great heroes, and the values of decisive action and personal liberty. While they don’t typically pray to a God, they are most likely to associate with Pelor, Trithereon, and St. Cuthbert. Started in Shur, but is spreading rapidly.
The Virmari Conclave - The Virmari worshipped all gods and made a point maintain temples to them all. They were known to assimilate the Gods of their conquered peopls into the conclave. Their principle God is Pholtus and they hold their emperor to be his archon on Teralon. Once the dominate religion of Shur it is falling out of favor.
While those are the big four of the region there are a number of other religions. The anamistic Zammaia from the east, the brutal Way of Ice from the north, and a host of local religions that survived the Virmari.
Magic and Technology
	Teralon is mostly in a feudal state, however magic has progressed some technology beyond that state. However, magi-tech cannot be mass produced and so is rare and expensive; it also often requires wizards to maintain it.
Factions and Intrigue
	So many. Too many to name.

## Chapter Three: Characters in Teralon
	Season one uses a lightly modified version of 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. The character creation is untouched and its options, restrictions, and recommendations are listed below. Any homebrewed options will be listed as such and their full details can be found in Appendix B. For  house rules and changes, see Appendix A.
A word about character creation.
	The primary rule for character creation is this: if it’s in the core book (PHB) it’s perfectly fine to use (with the sole exception of variant human). Otherwise, you have to ask me if it can be used AND you must tell me what book it’s from. If you use 5e tools or the 5e SRD it will tell you the source.
	With the exceptions listed above character creation is untouched.
Building a Character
All characters begin at level 2.
I highly recommend using the average HP on level up instead of rolling.
For attributes roll 4d6 and drop the lowest
You may trade a bonus language for a tool proficiency
If you take the starting gold (PHB 143) any left over gold is lost after character creation. (You may keep any gold given to you by your background).
After you finish building your character you will have three (3) sessions to make any changes so don’t worry about being perfect or making a mistake, you have time to fix it.
You may NOT take a feat before level 4. No exceptions.
Important Things to know
The values of money have been slightly adjusted, the new ratio is 1gp is worth 20sp and 1sp is worth 20cp. In game terms think of 1gp as being worth roughly $20 usd, 1sp is about $1, and 1cp is about 5¢. The average income is aroun 2k GP per year.
Common languages in the region are:
Common (a universal trade cant that has grown into a full language; English)
Aksal (the main language on Aglia, similar to Dutch)
Donsk (a regional language of Dontursk, similar to Swedish)
Luminus (the regional language of Shur, similar to Latin)
Uncommon Languages
An Focal (aka sylvan or Low Arcadian)
Grurusk (aka Goblin; not normally spoken by non-goblins)
Cach (not a language on its own, but an informal way to refer to other regional languages)

Rare or Specific languages
Draconic (spoken mostly by wizards)
Abyssal (spoken by demonic cultiest and certain inquisitors)
Note: Dwarvish, Elvish, and Gnomish have been condensed into An Focal (though they do have regional cants).



## Chapter Four: Windhurst, the Gentle Breeze
A somewhat cosmopolitan city in northern Aglia overseen by King Tor Ossler of house Rosenhurst.


Chapter Five: An Argent Dawn recap
	This chapter covers the game sessions of the “An Argent Dawn” campaign.
Dramatis Personae
	David as Daivok
	Ariel as Marigold
	Shannon as Emerald
	Gary as Clater
	Greg as Rusty
Session One: Of Revalry and Horror
	An impromptu tournament at “Deva-vu,” a tavern adjacent to and run by the Windhurst Adventuring Guild, saw the formation of the Fighting Mongosses, a team consisting of the PCs (who had yet to pick a ‘real’ name) and Kirk (some dude). The tournament saw Daivok demonstrate his fighting prowess, Rusty flyt his way to second place, Emerald pass out drunk, Marigold also passout drunk (though far later into the contest), and Clater dominate with a wondrous (and horrifying) display of magic. The Fighting Mongosses ended up in 3rd place and merriment was had by all.
	The next day the group was approached by Brachus Thorne, leader and warmind of the Defenders of Adenwal, who offered them a particularly sticky job from the guild.
	The nearby town of Gypsum, named after the particular quality of the stone it quarries, has had its exports interrupted by Kobolds. The town’s quarry, in operation for over 200 years, hit an underdark pocket and a group of Kobolds have been attacking the quarry in progressively more bold assaults. One miner has almost died and 2 more were greiveously ingured. The town has petitioned the guild for aid. The guild will pay 800gp for resolving the threat plus a bonus for each Kobold killed. (Resolving the threat means letting the quarry continue its work safely).
	The Mongooses set out for Gypsum and, after interviewing the quarrie’s foreman and buying 30lbs of beef, descended down into the underdark opening. They began scouting but were ambushed after Rusty triggered an acid trap (their defeat was decisive). After an intial unfocused response the group decided to retreat, rest, and learn more about their adversaries. Upon leaving the underdark they found a before unnoticed kobold graffiti that says “Mork sang-choo” in rough common letters.

Appendix A: House Rules
Attunement
	Attuning to a magic item is now automatic and now no longer requires a short rest. A character attunes to an item as soon as they use or wear the item. Attunement can be ended in all the same ways as before AND if an item is no longer magical.
	Characters may be attuned to a number of items at one time equal to 1 + their proficiency bonus (was 3). However, when an item becomes unattuned a short rest is required to get that ‘attunement slot’ back. This rest can be part of a rest that unattunes an item.
	E.g. Throgdor uses an articier’s Rocket Launcher (Fireball) and consumes its final charge. The launcher looses all magical properties and so Throgdor is no longer attuned to it, however he cannot attune to a new item until he spends a short rest meditating.

	Why? Honestly I never liked how attunement was added to the game. It makes sense but wasn’t implemented well. There’s no reason given as to why some items require attunement and others don’t. It feels very arbitrary and tacked on. It also addresses a “problem” that I don’t think ever existed. This change makes it a bit gentler, adds level scaling, and doesn’t fully remove it like I normally do. (Nerfs presented as random new mechanics is silly. Say what you mean WotC).


Saving throws
When a spell or ability you use causes an NPC to make a saving throw you instead make an attack roll using the same attribute you would use for your save DC. The attack is opposed by one of the target’s three save scores: Reflex, Constitution, Will.

Example 1: If a wizard casts the spell fireball they would make an attack against their target(s), adding their proficiency and intelligence to their roll, against their target(s)’ reflex defense.
Example 2: If a cleric casts command they would make an attack against their target, adding their proficiency and wisdom to their roll, against their target’s will defence.

If a target would have disadvantage on their save you instead have advantage on your attack and vise versa.

Why did I change this? In short, I have a lot on my plate and moving a bunch of my rolls over to the players has been successful in a number of my previous games.
Inspiration
	It’s gone. It’s a silly rule.
	To replace inspiration gaining advantage on actions is much easier. Note: It is OK to ask the group what you can do in a situation to gain advantage.

	Example 1: Sal wants to scale a crumbling wall and he would like to make sure he has advantage on the attempt, but he doesn’t know how to do it so he asks the other players what makes sense. A number of ideas are floated such as: use climbing tools, take your time, learn to fly (which is shot down by the GM).
	Example 2: Abby wants to whack a goblin with her club and wants to make sure she has advantage on the attempt, but can’t think of a way to get it so she polls the group. Sal says “I bet if we flank the goblin we’ll both have advantage, why don’t  you move to its other side”.

Note: If you don’t have advantage on an action you’re either in a desperate situation (a ‘hail mary’) or you’re not trying.

Why did I change this? I always forget to grant inspiration and player rarely remind me, so it’s mostly a dead rule. This change codifies my stance on it and gaining advantage.

Advantage and Disadvantage
	As per the base rules you not have more than one source of advantage or disadvantage and they cancel each other out. This means that a person standing in a fog cloud shooting an arrow at a target at long range in a strong wind has the same chance to hit as a person with only one of those disadvantages. Further, it means if someone cast “Truestrike” on them to grant them advantage they now have a standard roll. 
	While a roll can still only have a single instance of either advantage or disadvantage on it, both advantage and disadvantages stack for the purposes of determining which applies.
	Example 1 using the standard rules: Cid has cast true strike on himself and is attempting to shoot a fleeing orc. He is shooting at long range, in a strong wind, and at night. He makes a normal attack roll against the target.
	Example 2 using the modified rules: Cid has cast true strike on himself and is attempting to shoot a fleeing orc. He is shooting at long range, in a strong wind, and at night. He has 1 instance of advantage and 3 instances of disadvantage, thus his attack will be made with disadvantage.

Why did I change it? While I don’t require my games to be true to life, this is a little ridiculous. I changed it for my own sanity (plus I’ve been doing it anyways, now I’ve just written it down)

Added languages
See the character section
Change the value of money
1gp = ~20$
1sp = ~1$
1cp = ~.05$
1gp = 20sp = 400cp

This makes it easier to understand the value of coins. It also helps to answer the question of “Is 100gp a lot of money?”

Popcorn Initiative
These rules replace the normal initiative rules. You no longer roll for initiative. When initiative is required the participant with the highest initiative score goes first (context can create exceptions). After that individual’s turn they may choose who goes next. This continues until all participants act. The participant who goes LAST in a round chooses who goes FIRST in the next round (note: they may choose themselves). Exception: If a character takes the “Hold” action their turn ends, but they may be chosen again later in the round.
Once a participant has been chosen they may not be chosen again in the same round. The GM will CLEARLY list who is involved in each round. If an individual is secret or unknown they may state that but they MUST still have a stand in.
Example: Combat begins between 4 players and 3 orcs. The player with the highest initiative (the rouge) goes first. After this action they may choose who goes next. They may choose from the other 3 players and the orcs (who act as a single unit). They choose their fighter. After the fighter acts they may choose the next person from the remaining two players and the orcs. This continues until combat is complete.

Why did I do this? This is a system of initiative that I’ve been flirting with for years and has some really powerful upsides. It makes it very easy to co-ordinate team actions and build a cohesive team strategy. It also makes it easier to track and rewards good ideas.

Aspects - WIP NYI
This rule replaces ideals, bonds, and flaws as well as inspiration. This rule is primarily GM facing meaning it likely won’t effect players but it has the capacity to do so.
An aspect is a word or phrase that names something important to a character or scene. A character might be better lucky than good or an initiate of the umber glaive while a scene may be cluttered or a den of scum and villiany. Each of these aspects says something important about its subject and each can be used or invoked to add a benefit to an action or defense. Most aspects will be descriptive (scarred warrior, navel gazing apprentice) or purely beneficial (decorated duelist, master wordsmith) while some may be purely negative (fear of spiders, dangerously anemic) but the best are ambiguous (manners of a goat, the building is on fire and it’s not my fault) and can help or hurt, often in surprising ways.
Each player character will have 5 total aspects at once. One will relate to their class or profession, this is called the high concept.  The second, called the trouble, will relate to a major flaw or danger for the character. The final three are normal aspects.
To figure out a character’s aspects try and answer the following questions in as short and pithy a way as possible or summarize your answer as such. (All are written in first person).
What am I? How do I approach and overcome conflict? Do I have a job or calling beyond my class?
Try using the form <adjective> <class> or <race> <adjective> of the <noun>
Example: Brawny Wizard or Elven defender of Qual’ala or Stubborn goat of a Drwaven Ranger.
What am I afraid of or haunted by? What is my greatest weakness?
Example: Price on my head or fated to die horribly or phsyically scarred
Pick 3 of the following:
What happened on my very first adventure before I even had a class? What pushed me into life as an adventurer?
What happened when you met another character (another PC or an NPC) while recovering from or continuing your first adventure?
Do I have a distinctive style? Either a mode of dress or particularly distinctive set of skills?
Example: Vibrantly Clashing Colors give me confidence or Acolyte of Wei’Ji’Wo martial arts
Do I have a personal touchstone of particular importance to me? A person, object, place, or ideal that gives me strength.
Example: Faithful of Kord, or My father’s sword, or mama’s boy
Is there something that happens to me or that I do too often to be just chance?
Example: The building is on fire and it’s not my fault, or the Usual Suspect, or Sticky fingers
Is there something I love or hate so passionately that it shapes my character?
Example: Hatred of Giants, or Admirer of architecture
Do I have a quirk or flaw that helps define me?
Example: Sucker for a Pretty Face, or Meticuously Groomed
Does a part of my history, backstory, or racial identity really matter to me?
Example: Child of Yonduru, or Small town boy, or Elven Dancer Mystic
	Once you have your aspects you can use them in play by invoking them or they can be used against you by having them compelled. To invoke an aspect simply name an aspect that can help you and pay a Fate Point you may then choose one of the following:
Gain advantage or impose disadvantage the action before a roll is made.
Add +2 or impose -2 to the action after the roll has been made but before results have been revealed.
Reroll all dice involved in an action, using their original modifiers, after results have been revealed.
	Aspects can also be used or compelled against you. This will usually come in the form of “Because you have [aspect] and you're in [this situation], it would make sense if [consequence] happened to you.” It can also simply be a time when your aspect complicates your life. When this happens you will gain a fate point but also suffer some kind of consequence.
	Fate points can be gained in the following ways up to a max of 5:
You gain 1 FP each time a conflict begins
You gain 1 FP each time an aspect is compelled against you
You gain 1 FP at the beginning of the next scene after an aspect is used against you in a conflict
You gain 3 FP at the start of a session
Scenes, locations, events, and even the game itself can have aspects attached to them. These aspects can be used as compelled the same way character aspects can. For example if a scene has the aspect cramped you can invoke it to help you fight against someone with a large weapon.
Aspects can also be temporary. They can be created or imposed in several ways. An aspect can be created through an action — like creating the toppled crates aspect after knocking over a stack of crates — or they can be created as the result of an action — like the house is on fire! Aspect after lighting the house on fire. Aspects can also be imposed by an action or consequence. The most common of which is a wound which is an aspect granted after taking damage that would reduce you to 0HP (or after a particularly devastating critical hit). Another type of imposed aspect is given as the result of an action — like tied up and helpless after being ambushed or Frozen solid after being hit by an ice spell.

The pantheons are varied and many. Mostly broken up by religion. None are deemed “canonical” or “true” as the actual natures of the Gods are mysterious. These Gods represent how they are seen on Teralon and do NOT represent relative powerlevel. I.e. a “cosmic” God could be seen as under a “Local” God in a pantheon and that’s fine (no one on Teralon knows the truth of divinities). In fact in most cases people don’t try to sort out a hierarchy or pantheon. Some Gods (like Hextor and Heironeous) have familial ties, but most just exist. A written pantheon says more about the ones who wrote it than it does about any of the Gods.
