The Underbog
	A cavern complex deep beneath gypsum that has been overrun with a parasitic necroantic fungus that enslaves/raises the dead (ala the Flood). Once a volcaic basin now an acidic swamp.

Upper reaches — The Quarry
	An old cavern mined out by deep dwarves that once held quantities of sulpher. The mined area extends under most of the above town’s quarry (it will soon run out of the Gypsum stone they mine). This area has been claimed by the remainders of a Kobold clan that has fortified a  crevice to the west. There are 4 Kobolds (Black) living there after their clan was decimated by the Ecthalpa.

Upper reaches — Kobold Crevice (Blackstone Holdout)
	The remaining few members of the Blackstone clan have fortified this area. They were discussing what to do next when the miners from Gypsum broke into the cavern. They had scavenged a few drawven tools which has helped them fortify. They have spread acid traps around the area and made a few ‘murder holes’ in the stone, but they are crude.

Upper reachers — the Chimney
	A thin chimney that is in the corner of the Quarry that leads down to the Acid Springs.

Upper reaches — The Seam
	The original sulpher seam the deep dwarves mined before hitting the larger vein below Gypsum. This was a thin offshoot from the main vein and has the remains of a dwarven mining camp at the far end. Fully abandoned.

Upper reaches — The Tunnels
	This is a dense and winding complex of tunnels, most quite small, covering several miles. It has many dead ends. It exits into the Underbog and extends deeper into the underdark, however, that exit is barred. Flood sometimes wander the tunnels and an Umber Hulk has been hibernating there.

Upper reachers — Acid Spring
	A steaming body of water that is, perhaps, 200’ wide and 60’ deep sits in this cavern. The water is  sulphuric acid and has gradually eaten away the floor of the cavern becoming deeper (but also becoming more diluted). Blue phosphoresent fungi glows beneath the surface and the smell of sulpher is strong. A weak trickle of water comes through a wall and leads to the Underbog. There is a path that leads to the Molten Heart.

Upper reachers — Molten Heart
	A remnant of ancient volcanic activity infused by elemental energy. The veil between the plane of fire is weak. A fire elemental slumbers in the cavern, its heat warming the waters of the spring. A series of volcanic tunnels leads deeper in the Underdark.

Upper reaches — Underbog
	A massive cavern created by volcanic activity but has filled with water over the years. The remnant sulpher, remnant heat, and water has turned the cavern into a vibrant (though acidic) ecology. A myriad of fungi grow there including the culture known as Ecthalpa (necromantic fungi) which came into being due to the rich magical energies at play within the cavern (fire, water, acid, death).
	Home to a number of rare fungi and reagents.

Upper reachers — Terrorfen
	Ecthalpa lives here. The most decayed of its ‘spores’ (beings it has taken over) stay here and are slowly eaten. It has a troll, 2 dwarves, and 8 Kobolds as its spores (the rest have been fully eaten). It cannot speak itself, but can speak through its spores. It has a symbiotic relationship with the screamer mushrooms spread through the bog and can ‘feel’ when they trigger (blind sense).
