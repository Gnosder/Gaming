A treatise on the life and behaviors of Kobolds.

## Insert -- For the Rushed

This insert has been added by the publisher and is intended for those who require a breif overview of the subject. This insert will follow many of the practices laid out by the Cathan Adventurer's Guild in their "Beastiary" folios.

 ### Dangers

Kobolds, while small and cowardly are also cunning. Their cunning should NEVER be underestimated. They are expert trap makers and, combined with their small size and draconic properties, master skirmishers.

#### Traps

- High Danger
- Poison is all but certain (especially with Green Kobolds)
- Acid/Fire is common with Black/Red Kobolds

Kobold traps are usually simple in construction, using mostly found materials, however this simplicity belies the deadly efficency at which the traps work. Kobolds also have found a way to imbue their traps (and occastionally their armaments) with elemental power related to their draconic heratage.

#### Warrens (Den)

- Beware clusters of 1' diameter holes
- Often full of hidden passages/tunnels
- Often heavily trapped
- Several dozen to a hundred Kobolds can be expected. 2/3 of whom are combatants.

When entering a Kobold warren take extra care if you see holes in the walls that are around a 1' diameter. These are often used as muder holes for Kobolds to fire arrows, darts, or drop rocks, oil, or flaiming objects. There is usually a small network of tunnels that connect all these holes together.

#### Tactics

- Wolf pack and Ambush tactics preffered
- Easily frightened without leadership
- Weak individually, but use numbers to their advantage

When combating Kobolds directly focus on making yourself look big and intimidating, kobolds are easily cowed. However, one or more of their number may need to be killed or incapacitated for their courage to fail them. If they have a shaman or clear leader then it is unlikely for them to flee while the leader lives as they will often fear him/her more than they will fear you.


## Introduction

My name is Coppernicus Grushma Balac Salizar Halfoot. I am a scholar and ranger of the Halfoot caravan. I studied natural sciences under the tutalage of Byron Oakenheart of the Cynar Grove outside Hertfort.

As a young boy I was facinated with beasts of all types and strove to learn all I could. As I grew my facination turned to the more predetary beasts of the forests and hills around my home. One day, a few moons before I became a man, a group of adventurers stumbled into our caravan. They were battered, but in good spirits. They told riviting stories of how they had fought their way into a nearby Gnoll encampment to recover some particularly valuable cargo the beastmen had taken. I knew of the gnolls, of course, we were all wary anytime we were in the area even though the beastmen never attaked such a large caravan. However I found myself in awe at some of the more mundane parts of the stories. 

The adventurers told us of seeing the gnoll pups (which their druid constantly remarking how cute they were) in communal huts. They showed us tools and art works they had taken from the camp. I had always seen beastmen as little more than savage creatures to be avoided, but now I was being confronted with the fact that they were possessed of culture and community. They may have been savage creatures, but they were far more complicated then anyone ever spoke of. Whenever hunters or elders would speak of beastmen they would usually just call them monsters and leave it at that.

In the years that followed I made a point to research beastmen at every town we visted and at each I found much of the same. Short folios of "statistics" or lists of weaknesses. Often there were mentions of "common tactics" or warnings on how to avoid them. They were treated with the same disdain as common highwaymen. Best avoided, fought if needed, dismissed if possible.

I set out to correct this. If knowledge is important, and I belive that it is, then nothing should be omited. All aspects of a subject should be researched and presented, not just that which helps one to better kill it.

I am not here trying to say how Gnolls and Goblinoids are people and should be treated as such. Too often have I seen the wanton destruction the beastmen have caused and their foul Gods leave little sympathy in my heart. I am, however, going to assert that the Beastmen are not JUST monsters. There is more to them than their savagery and violence. 

This tome is the sum total of all my learnings, some from dusty libraries, most from my time as an adventuring scholar, on Kobolds, reptelian creatures with an ancient draconic connection.

## Chapter One -- An Introduction to the Kobold

It is entierly excusable if you have never heard of Kobolds. They tend to stay clear of civilized lands and, odd incursion aside, are rarely ever seen by all but the most adventuerous boarderlanders. There are two types of Kobolds which I will call Chromatic and Degenerate.

A kobold is a small reptelian humanoid creature. They stand between 2' and 2'6" tall and tend to weigh beween 35 and 45 pounds. The skin of Chromatic Kobolds is covered in scales of varioues colors while degernerate Kobolds are a ruddy brown to onyx black. Their eyes are often orange or red with reptilian slits. Their body is sineous and sleek, their hands ending with three clawed fingers and an opposible thumb, their legs digitigraded like a cat, their jaws are narrow with a strong bite force like an aligator. Like most reptiles they lack ears and a nose save for slits. They have boney ridges on their heads and sometimes have small horns. They have muscular non-autotomus tails that tend to be 2/3 as long as they are tall.

Minor regional differences aside Kobolds smell overwhelming of "wet dog palying in stagnant water" however they often mask their scent with dirt and mud before hunting.

Kobolds speak a simplified form of the already simplified Low-Draconic Dialect which I have dubbed Koboldese, useful if not overly creative. They seem to know this language almost instinctially and require very little education. In fact they seem to have a great deal of "instinctual knowledge".

Some Kobolds have dragon like wings and it's still unknown how they get them. I believe that it is a gift that can be bestowed by Dragons. Chromatic Kobolds are far more likely to have wings than their degenerate breathren.

### Kobold Chromatisim

Chromatic is a word that can be found often when reading about Dragons. Breifly there are 2 main varities of dragons Metalic known as the "good" dragons, and Chromatic, or the "evil" dragons. The most common chromatic dragons are Red, Blue, Green, White, and Black and are related to the elements Fire, Lightning, Poison, Ice, and Acid respectivly.

## Chapter Two -- On the Origins of Kobolds

There are many posited origins of the Kobold. The most common, and one to which they themselves often pass on, is that Kobolds were created by Dragons to serve them and guard their clutches. In deed any kobold given half the chance will eagerly pledge eternal servitutde to a dragon. Dragons for their part seem more amused by this than anything and their true thoughts are beyond the scope of this work.

## Chapter Three -- On Kobold Society

While rightly classified as beastmen, Kobolds have their own culture and it is precisly this reason that I find it so neccesary to create these books.

Kobolds tend to gather in groups that I call Warrens and are sometimes refered to as tribes (though I do not think they have quite acheived all that the word implies). Each warren is quite large for beastmen ranging from 50-250 adults and up to 3 times that many children. Larger 'warren cities' are very rare and usually only occur under the stewardship of a Dragon.

These warrens are the bedrock social institution of the Kobold.

### Kobold's Meaning of Life

Most creatures live to procreate. They eat, fight for mates, and mate. Kobolds are not much different however they have a larger "directive", for lack of a better word. That being to "Serve dragonkind in all things and ways". This directive is inate and overpowers all other needs. A Kobold will wither away from hunger in a pit of meat if a Dragon demands it of them. 

Kobolds also have an intense hatred of "warm bloods", though in reality this hatred extends to other cold blood sentient creatures as well. So it is perhaps better summed up by saying "They hate any thinking thing that is not a Kobold or a Dragon." They have a particular hatred for gnomes and often confuse any humanoid creature, regardless of size, as being a gnome.

Kobolds continue their race by agressivly procreating. A female Kobold can lay dozens of eggs in her life. Which is fortunate as less than a third of Kobold young live to adulthood. In terms of who gets to mate and with whom, this right is almost always reserved excluslivy by the high dragonspeaker of each warren. The speaker will often give breeding rights to favored individuals and their own direct lineage. Kobold eggs are seen as communal property and parantage is rarely respected (outside the speaker's own nepotism).

    This can result in distrubingly inbred Kobolds if one "line" stays speaker for too long. Fortunatly this is rarely an issue.

Finally Kobolds live to eat. It is their favorite past time and they count their days by their meals. Despite their love for food and omniverous nature Kobolds prefer raw and unseasoned red meat above any other food. They will eat just about anything (I have even seen evidence of Kobolds having eaten rocks. This is perhaps similar to how chickens eat stone to aid in digestion, but I'm unconvienced), however only meat will slake their hunger.

    A kobold of the "ref users" warren (a name given by a merchant they ate that they didn't understand and took as their own) once "starved" to death when he was given an "endless" amount fruits, which he devoured, but was denied meat for a prolonged period of time (several months). The kobold endlessly devoured the fruit and just as endlessly complained about how hungrey he was. In the end he ate himself to death.

The priorities of a Kobold look like this:
- Serve Dragonkind in all things and ways
- Kill anything that is not a Kobold or a Dragon (especially Gnomes)
- Procrate
- Eat meat
