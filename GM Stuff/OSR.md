Multi-classing made easy
"HP" is based on level not class

casting spells has a 'weak' version, a 'safe' version, and an 'overcharged' version
    Weak version is free (cantrip). Not all spells have one.
    safe version is 'take 10' and costs a few HP (equal to drain value)
    Overcharged is 'choose bonus up to double magic' lose HP based on roll.
        If HP scales linearly then cost to cast spells should also scale. Maybe each spell has a drain value that multiplis how much HP is lost
