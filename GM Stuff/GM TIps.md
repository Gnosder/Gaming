# GM Tips

Largely drawn from the Alexandrian, the Angry GM, and my own experiences. This will codify best practices and a game "flow".

## Game Flow

## Tip: Roll Initiative at end of combat

    Source: Alexandrian

    Tip: Roll initiaitve for the next combat at the end of the current combat.

    Idea: Roll initiative in advance (GM rolls).

    Problem: Initiative does not take into account an individual character's prep save for surprise rounds.
    The Reason: Breaking up the initiation of combat ("5 goblins run screaming out of the bushes") with the actual resolution of combat ("I kill the goblins") with rolling intiative is slow, cumbersome, and drags down excitment. I've tried to resolve this in the past with the "popcorn intiative" house rule but that too bogs things down, just in a different way.

## Best Practice: Reaction Points

    Soure: Alexandrian

    Tip: Identify the reaction point in narration and narrate up to that point only, then allow players to react.
    Definition: A reaction point is the point in any scene or narration where the characters may react to what is happening around them.

    The Reason: Cutscenes suck.

## Tip: 3 of 5 (Descriptions)

    Soure: Alexandrian

    Tip: When describing a scene describe 3 of the 5 senses. Usually sight plus 2 of Hearing, Smell, Touch. Can use an action verb in place of a sense.

        Touch: Wind/Temp

    Example: "You enter a tattered library that smells of dust. Old books are scattered about and you see a goblin digging through the tomes. As you enter it jolts in surprise and emits a high piched squeak."

## Tip: 2 Cool Things (Descriptions)

    Soure: Alexandrian

    Tip: Try to include 2 cool, but irrelevant details in every scene description.

## Tip: Three-by-Three (Descriptions)

    Soure: Alexandrian

    Tip: Try to share no more than 3 elements with no more than 3 details each.

    Why: Three details take up as much brain space as infinite details. Thus anything beyond 3 is redundant

## BP: Description doesn't End

    Soure: Alexandrian

    Practice: Continue to work descriptions inside scenes and not just at the start.

## BP: Keep it Pithy

    Soure: Alexandrian, et al.

    Practice: Keep descriptons and narrations short and to the point.

    Brevity is the soul of wit. Etc.

## BP: Room Keys

    Source: Alexandrian

    Order of Keys:

    Title of the Room

    Boxed Text / "At a Glance"

    Reactive Skill Checks

    Significant Elements
        "Element

            How to find (Unfound element)

            On Closer Inspection

            With active interaction"

    Note: Can add "GM background" to any item

## Tip: Using Initiative (untested)

    Source: Personal EXP

    Tip: Don't roll for initiative. Determine surprise. Intiative works in the following order: Ambusher > Panic > Players(and allies) > Adversaries = Neutral. Let PCs act mostly freely. Default to Left > Right.

## Tip: Fail by Five

    Source: Angry GM, DnD 3.5

    Tip: Create tension and fumble mechanics on certain checks by implementing a "fail by five" rule where as something beyond "failure" happens when you roll 5 or less than the DC.

    Example: While making a climb check characters fall if they fail by 5 or more.

    Tension is good. Fumbles are good. Stakes are Good.

## Tip: Set Design

    Source: Hack and Slash

    Tip: When writing room descriptions put at a glance info in bold and use "->" to denote when something is inside something else or when more investigation is required. The order items is listed is the actual order the items are in. ANy word that is unimportant is not used.

    Example from Hack and Slash:
        Small Alcove 32) | **Refuse**, **Furniture**, **Bones**->in corner, 8 Ghouls!
                                    (AC 6, HD 2, +3/1d4-1/1d4-1/1d6, Para 1d6+2, ML (20) XP 175)
        **Ornate Iron Armchair**-> Dwarven, decorative cobalt inlay (900gp) 65lbs. + Bulky.
        **Blanket** (60gp) Chiffon, covering-> **ottoman**, Hollow slate **upholstered** in woven twill. (200 gp) 35lbs. + Bulky.
            -> **Gem**, Kunzite  /mi (202 gp) 
            -> Human sized **Iron mail Armor** (Chain +1, weightless)
            -> **Fleece Pouch** (Pouch of Accessibility)
            -> **3 Scrolls** (Scroll-Protection from lycanthropes, Scroll-Cursed, 
                Scroll-Cleric, spell levels 1,2,4,5,6,6)
        **Sack**, Moleskin(10gp) Horsehair cord->platinum aiguillette-> 3 vs/vf Rubies (400 gp)
            -> 400 gp, 200 hs, and 80 pp
