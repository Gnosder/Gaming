The basic rules of the game, how they fit together and, when they matter.

## Game Dice

This game uses only 10 sided dice. Players will only ever need 3, while game masters should a 'handful'.

## Actions

When the GM asks you to make a check, roll 2d10 and add the relevant modifiers. You'll want to make sure to add:

- The relevant attribute
- The relevant skill
- Any situational or equipment bonuses
- Subtract any situational or equipment penalties

This will generate a result that is usually* between 3 and 35, with results of 15 being the most likely. Compare the number you rolled to the difficulty class (DC; sometimes referred to as the TN or target number) that the GM has set.

- If your number is 10 greater than the DC, you score a critical success.
- If your number is greater than the DC, but 10 above it, you scrore a success.
- If your number is less than the DC, but not 10 below it, you fail the check.
- If your number is 10 below the DC, you receive a critical failure.

The consequences of success and failure will be dependant on the action being taken and the narritve around it.

## Contests

Some action will be contested. Particularly in combat or social situations. In this case, the DC will be set by your target. In the case of NPCs the DC is listed on their reference sheet. In the case of player verses player action, both players will make the appropriate check and compare their results with the higher of them winning.

## Defense and Damage

Every creature and object has a defense score. For NPCs this score is typically static, for players this is a check -- typically Reaction + Armor. If an incomming attack is higher than a targets defense score the target takes damage listed on the attack. The damage is removed first from Vitality and then any excess flows over to the target's wounds.

## Wounds and Vitality

This game uses a two part system of health. Vitality represents stamina, grit, and determination. You will use it to use certain abilities and you will lose it first when you take damage or suffer consequences. Vitality regenerates quickly with just short rests. When your vitality is at 0, you take a static -4 penalty to all actions and defenses.
Wounds represent your actual physical health and will typically only be lost when your vitality is at 0. Wounds recover slowly and might have additional consequences with them -- like broken bones, missing limbs, etc. When your wounds reach 0, you are dying.

### Dying

When your wounds are at 0, you at risk of death. On each of your turns after reaching 0 wounds, you make a Will save against a DC of 12. If you fail this save, you are dead. If you succeed, you hold on for one more round.
> Don't forget to include all relevant penalties. Like from vitality and any consequences. This is a hard save to pass.
> This makes it so that you can't be killed by a single hit, but puts you in a dire situation. Death is assured without assistance.

### Massive Damage

If you ever lose half or more of your wounds from a single action, you must make a Fort save against DC 18 or fall unconcious for a number of hours equal to the wounds you lost. This time can be reduced by recieving medical help.

### Co-ordination

### Aptitude

## Derived Stats

### Vitality

Vitality Scales with Level (nothing else does). Perhaps resolve x 4 at level 1 and + resolve each level after that.

## Skills

Skills come in 2 braod types: Active and Knowledge. Characters are likely to use active skills to make checks through the course of play for things like attacking, gathering information, or overcoming obsticles. Knowledge skills on the other hand are rarely rolled, when they become needed their rank is compared to a DC. A character either knows something or they do not, there is no drama in rolling to 'remember' something.

<!-- Brawling -- by style
    Weaponry -- By weapon
    Shooting -- By weapon
    Athletics -- Climbing, Swimming, Running, Gymnatics, Jumping
    Subterfuge -- Stealth, Sleight of Hand, shadowing
    Driving -- By vehicle

    Research
Presence
    Animal Handeling -- By animal
    Socialize -- Diplomacy, Bluff, Intimidate, Sense Motive, Etiquette

### Weaponry

### Shooting

### Athletics

### Subterfuge

### Driving

### Crafting

### Researching

### Animal Handeling

### Socialize

### Knowledges

This is a broad category of skills, that can't be fully defined. The list presented here is an example of some of the most commonly used knowledges. Knowledge skills function the same as active skills excpet in this way: exceptionally broad or regionally specific knowledges require a specilization at level 1. They can still be given secondary specilizations at level 4. E.g. Local is a regionall specific and must have a specilization at level 1 to reflect the area it encompases. This on its own is very broad, but a good baseline here would be 'the area of a region a local would know about'. When in doubt talk to your GM.
